Whileplatinum-based doublet therapy is the traditional treatment ofchoice for advanced/metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), no speciﬁc regimen is clearly superior, and efﬁ-cacy with these regimens has reached a plateau in terms of overallresponse rate (RR; ∼25%–35%) and median overall survival (OS;8–10 months) [2].  Molecular testing for epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog(KRAS) mutations has allowed for the identiﬁcation of subsets ofpatients who will be more responsive to certain therapies. Conse-quently, the treatment of patients with NSCLC is evolving towarda more personalized approach that utilizes speciﬁc molecular andgenetic tumor proﬁles in treatment decisions. In addition to oncol-ogists, radiologists, and pathologists, pulmonologists are essential"

In thedouble-blind phase III ISEL study, high EGFR gene copy number wasassociated with a lower risk of death with geﬁtinib vs placebo (haz-ard ratio [HR] for death, 0.61; P = 0.067), and patients with tumorsexpressing EGFR had signiﬁcantly improved OS with geﬁtinib vsthose whose tumors did not express EGFR (P = 0.049) [12]. Simi-larly, univariate analysis from the phase III BR.21 study showed thatOS was longer with erlotinib vs placebo in patients whose tumorsexpressed EGFR (HR, 0.68; P = 0.02) or had high EGFR copy number(HR, 0.44; P = 0.008) [14]. However, multivariate analysis revealedthat EGFR expression or EGFR copy number was not signiﬁcantlyassociated with survival beneﬁt in either treatment group.The issue of whether EGFR mutations or increased EGFR copynumber (detected via ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization [FISH])is the better biomarker for EGFR-TKI response was clariﬁed byexploratory analysis of the IPASS trial [25]. Patients with high EGFRcopy number had improved PFS with geﬁtinib vs chemotherapy(HR = 0.66, 95% conﬁdence interval, 0.50–0.88; P = 0.005). However,post hoc exploratory analyses showed this effect was primar-ily driven by overlap of high EGFR copy number with positiveEGFR-mutation status (among the 249 patients who were FISH pos-itive, 190 (78%) also harbored an EGFR mutation). Patients whowere FISH positive/mutation negative derived little or no beneﬁtfrom geﬁtinib; however, patients with EGFR mutations overall hadsigniﬁcantly longer PFS with geﬁtinib (P < 0.001) [16], suggestingthat EGFR-mutation status is the primary determinant of responseto geﬁtinib and consequently the preferred biomarker to predictEGFR-TKI beneﬁt."
