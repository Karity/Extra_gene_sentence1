            'Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane growth factor receptor whichplays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, survival, and growth [54]. This receptor isusually present in its inactive form as a monomer. Upon binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF),EGFR dimerizes and autophosphorylates, leading to activation of downstream intracellular signalingcascades such as RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR (Figure 1) [24]. Mutations in EGFR thatresult in its constitutive activation are believed to be an important contributor to the tumorigenesis ofmany cancer types, including lung cancer. It has been reported that sensitizing mutations in the EGFRtyrosine kinase (TK) domain at exons 18–21 occur in about 15–18% of NSCLC patients, among whichthe L858R point mutation in exon 21 and a deletion in exon 19 (residues 747–750) constitute about 40%and 45% of EGFR mutations, respectively [55]. Exon 20 insertions account for roughly 9% of activatingEGFR mutations, and prognosis for NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertion mutant EGFR is generallyquite poor [56].',
            'Figure 1. Mechanisms of resistance to molecularly targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as ALK, c-MET, and EGFR lead to activation of downstream signaling pathways that are responsible for cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) inhibit receptor activation. However, due to mutations listed in the figure and activation of alternative signaling pathways, tumor cells acquire resistance against these TKIs. Activation of PI3K/mTOR, Wnt, and RAS-MAPK pathways may cause resistance to TKIs. Dimerization of IGF-1R with EGFR may activate the Akt and MAPK pathways despite inhibition. ',
            'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to inhibit mutated EGFR and its constitutive activation. The first generation of EGFR TKIs includes erlotinib and gefitinib. They reduce aberrant EGFR signaling via reversible inhibition of the ATP-binding pocket in the EGFR kinase domain. Unfortunately, the development of TKI resistance is common after prolonged use of these EGFR TKIs [9]. One major mechanism for the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is the development of the T790M secondary mutation within the EGFR kinase domain. The bulkier methionine residue at position 790 sterically hinders its interaction with TKIs and increases affinity for ATP, thus reducing inhibitor binding to the EGFR kinase domain while preserving catalytic activity [10]. Nevertheless, the T790M ‘gatekeeper’ mutation only attributes to 50% of all acquired resistance [57]. Therefore, a significant portion of acquired resistance arises from other mechanisms, such as upregulation of the mTOR pathway or EMT [58,59]. Additional secondary mutations such as D761Y, T854A, and L747S (Figure 1) are reported to arise subsequently to the EGFR TKI sensitizing L858R mutation and cause resistance [11]. In cell lines which are intrinsically resistant due to the presence of mutated EGFR, increased activity of TGF-β, which is often produced during an inflammatory response, has been shown to initiate transition to mesenchymal-like cell morphology accompanied by increased mobility, invasiveness, and resistance to erlotinib [60]. Inflammation also induces IL-6 secretion, which further bolsters resistance to erlotinib. It has been proposed that IL-6 upregulation corresponds with increased levels of Survivin, BCL-X1, and BCL-2 in the erlotinib-resistant cells, which suggests that ',

            'mutation, suggesting that inhibition of HER2 may prove a promising target to bypass EGFR TKIresistance [68]. Inappropriate ampliﬁcation of MET, a gene that codes for an epithelial RTK thatactivates signaling of the MAPK, PI3K, and SRC pathways upon binding by its ligand, hepatocytegrowth factor (HGF) [69], stimulates the AKT pathway and is also a major contributor to EGFR TKIsecondary resistance (Figure 1). MET ampliﬁcation causes overexpression of the MET receptor andactivation of its downstream signaling pathways. In fact, MET gene ampliﬁcation is shown to beone of the most relevant mechanisms responsible for the acquired resistance against EGFR TKIs(Figure 2) [70]. Crosstalk between c-MET and EGFR signaling pathways has also been observed [71,72].Puri et al. have demonstrated that TKIs against c-MET and EGFR have a synergistic inhibitoryeffect on proliferation [72]. Furthermore, a recent study has also identiﬁed c-MET activation andupregulation of its associated ligand, HGF, as mediators of resistance to TKIs in VEGFR-mutantNSCLC. In this study, activation of the c-MET pathway also resulted in the formation of tortuousblood vessels within associated tumors [73]. More speciﬁcally, MET ampliﬁcation has been shown topromote geﬁtinib resistance by activating PI3K through ERBB3 (HER3) despite EGFR inhibition viageﬁtinib [70]. Another study found inhibition of c-MET in MET-ampliﬁed NSCLC led to activationof the EGFR pathway [74]. Thus, EGFR/c-MET combination therapy could be a possible strategy toovercome c-MET resistance [75]. A recent study conducted by our laboratory found upregulation ofmTOR and Wnt signaling proteins in c-MET/EGFR resistant NSCLC cell lines, implying the role ofalternative cell signaling pathways in TKI resistance [63]. This suggests that a combination of Wnt andmTOR inhibitors with c-MET or EGFR inhibitors may improve the prognosis in NSCLC. However,further clinical trials are needed to conﬁrm these results. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)is another RTK whose activation could contribute to acquired EGFR TKI resistance. IGF-1R has thepotential to dimerize with EGFR after treatment with erlotinib, transducing signals to the AKT andMAPK signaling pathways that would otherwise be silenced by erlotinib (Figure 1). Inhibition ofIGF-1R has been shown to enhance the effects of ﬁrst generation EGFR TKIs, providing a possibleroute to overcome resistance [76].',
            'The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the ALK genelocalized on chromosome 2 and is often associated with lung cancer when mutated. This kinaseis typically expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems [85,86].ALK is reportedto regulate several different pathways involved in cellular proliferation and survival, such asPI3K-AKT-mTOR, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, and the JAK-STAT pathway, once it dimerizes and is activatedby autophosphorylation after binding with its ligands, pleiotrophin (PTN), and midkine (MK) [87,88](Figure 1). In lung cancer patients, ALK gene ampliﬁcation, mutation, and rearrangement is known tobe associated with tumor development [88–90], and around 5% of NSCLC cases are diagnosed with anALK gene rearrangement [90].Crizotinib, a ﬁrst generation ALK TKI, has been approved by the FDA for treating locally advancedor metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC tumors by competitively binding to the ATP-binding site [25].Due to acquired resistance to crizotinib, the efﬁcacy of this TKI is limited to approximately 1 year.Secondary mutations in the ALK gene are considered to be the most frequent mechanisms mediatingresistance to ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib. Point mutations such as L1196M, C1156Y, F1174L,and F1174V (Figure 1) in the ALK kinase domain have been found in NSCLC patients treated withcrizotinib. These mutations render crizotinib less effective by decreasing ligand afﬁnity for its activesite [24,26,27]. A recent study reported that the F1174V mutation may induce secondary crizotinibresistance via an alteration in secondary structure of the protein, resulting in a conformational changewithin the ALK kinase domain and thus reducing crizotinib afﬁnity and efﬁcacy [28]. The gatekeepermutation L1196M in ALK kinase domain confers resistance to crizotinib [24,29] by concurrentlyincreasing and decreasing the binding afﬁnities of ATP and ALK inhibitors, respectively. The othersecondary mutation C1156Y causes resistance by inducing a marked allosteric effect on the ATP-bindingsite of the ALK kinase domain [30]. Another study reported the presence of L1196M and G1269Apoint mutations of the crizotinib target site in four out of eleven patients treated with crizotinib [27].Katayama et al. identiﬁed new mutations such as G1202R, S1206Y, and 1151Tins (Figure 1) in four ofeighteen ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib [26]. Additionally, in parallelwith mutations, copy number gain of the ALK gene rearrangement has been shown as a potentialmechanism of resistance to crizotinib. The copy number gain was observed due to more copies ofthe ALK rearrangement per cell and an increase in cells displaying the rearrangement pattern in thepatients treated with crizotinib [26,27].Recently, Wilson et al. conducted a large-scale functional genomics study using a genome-scalelentiviral expression library of human open reading frame (ORF) to identify novel genes conferringresistance to ALK inhibitors, crizotinib, and TAE684 (a second-generation ALK inhibitor). This studydemonstrated that the neuregulin-1 and P2Y purinergic G-protein coupled receptor proteins mediateresistance to the ALK inhibitors, TAE684 and crizotinib, in lung cancer [31]. Some other studiesfocusing on the mechanism of resistance to crizotinib have shown involvement of mutations in EGFRand KRAS [27], activation of the ErbB family through phosphorylation [26], EMT [91], activation of the',
            'insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway [92], KIT ampliﬁcation [26], and autophagy [93].A recent study also performed a multi-phospho-RTK antibody array to screen for secondary RTKinvolvement in ALK inhibitor resistance within two crizotinib-resistant and one TAE684-resistantcell line, further implicating EGFR, IGF-1R, and HER, as well as MET, in acquired ALK inhibitorresistance [94].Ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib (AP26113) are amongst the second generation of ALK TKIswhich have been developed to overcome resistance to ﬁrst generation TKIs conferred by ALK kinasedomain mutations [33,34]. Brigatinib has shown efﬁcacy in ﬁrst generation TKI-resistant ALK mutantscarrying C1156Y, I1171S/T, V1180L, L1196M, L1152R/P, E1210K, and G1269A mutations, and it hasdemonstrated therapeutic potency following crizotinib treatment [43]. Metastasis into the centralnervous system is a common complication of NSCLC patients carrying mutant ALK undergoingtreatment with crizotinib, and second generation TKIs, namely alectinib, have demonstratedtherapeutic activity in treating central nervous system metastasis in ALK-positive NSCLC patients [95].Furthermore, alectinib was recently shown to be more effective and less toxic than crizotinib in treatingALK-positive NSCLC as a ﬁrst line therapy, demonstrating a 12-month event-free survival rate of 68.4%in comparison to 48.7% with crizotinib [38]. However, there are other mutations which have arisenthat limit these next-generation inhibitors, as well. As with the ﬁrst generation of TKIs, speciﬁc ALKgene mutations confer resistance to the various second generation TKIs, such as G1202R, I1171T/N/S,and V1180L for alectinib, and G1202R and F1174C/V (Figure 1) for ceritinib [35,39–42]. Additionally,several studies have shown involvement of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET signaling pathwayactivation in the acquired resistance to alectinib [96,97].A few other studies have reported that EGFR ligands [98] and hypoxia-induced EMT conferresistance to alectinib [91]. It has been shown that HGF, a ligand of MET, induces resistance to alectinib,but not to crizotinib, via activation of MET signaling in NSCLC cell lines [97,98]. Recently, Toyokawaet al. reported a novel ALK G1123S mutation in ALK-positive NSCLC patients acquiring resistance toceritinib [36]. Another in vitro study on a human-derived neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), withG1123S or G1123D mutations at codon 1123, showed resistance to an ALK inhibitor, TAE684 [32].A novel T1151K mutation has also been described in a patient that demonstrated cancer progressionfollowing treatment with crizotinib and ceritinib [37]. These mutations could either sterically blockATP binding and/or alter the glycine-rich loop dynamics, perturbing interactions with ALK inhibitorsthat require a speciﬁc conformation of the loop for binding [32]. Additionally, one recent study showedreactivation of the RAS-MAPK pathway (Figure 1) as a novel mechanism of acquired resistance inALK-positive lung cancers [99]. This study also identiﬁes new potential biomarkers of ALK-inhibitorresistance and provides a potential explanation for the role of the upstream EML4 (echinodermmicrotubule-associated protein like 4) fusion partner in driving chronic ALK signaling. This studyalso demonstrates that a combination of both ALK and the RAS-MAPK component MEK inhibitorscould be a potential approach to overcome resistance and improve the prognosis of ALK-positive lungcancer [99].Third-generation ALK inhibitors have been under development to overcome second-generationinhibitor resistance in ALK-positive NSCLC patients.Amongst these molecules are lorlatinib(PF-06463922), entrectinib (RxDx-101), and ensartinib (X-398). Lorlatinib serves as an ATP-competitiveTKI for both ALK and ROS1, an RTK in the insulin receptor family with striking similarity to ALKthat is overexpressed in several cancer types, but absent in normal lung tissue. ROS1 rearrangementis present in 1–2% of NSCLC cases, and detection of these rearrangements is critical in selectingappropriate inhibitor-based treatment for NSCLC [100]. Lorlatinib has also demonstrated efﬁcacy intreating ALK-positive NSCLC metastases to the central nervous system. As part of Phase 1–2 clinicaltrials, 54 ALK or ROS1-mutation positive patients were treated with lorlatinib, demonstrating anoverall response rate of 50%. Common adverse effects were limited to hypercholesterolemia andperipheral edema [44]. Entrectinib serves a three-fold role as an inhibitor of ALK and ROS1, as wellas NTRK1–3 fusion proteins, which are receptor tyrosine kinases that control synaptic strength and',
            'BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) is a member of the RAFserine/threonine protein kinases family. BRAF encodes for a RAF kinase that signals downstreamof RAS to activate the MAPK pathway, which causes uncontrolled growth and differentiation uponmutation [103]. BRAF is the most commonly mutated gene in melanoma; however, BRAF mutationshave also been shown to be associated with NSCLC with a frequency of approximately 2–3% of cases.In melanoma, valine 600Glu (V600E) mutation within exon 15 of the kinase domain constitutes morethan 90% of mutations in melanoma. In lung cancer, the V600E mutation is the most common mutation,yet they also occur at other positions within the kinase domain. A study reported BRAF mutations in18 (3%) out of 697 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. V600E BRAF mutation was observed in 50% ofthese 18 patients, while G469A and D594G were found in 39% and 11%, respectively [104]. Anotherrecent study reported seven out of 273 NSCLC cases (2.6%) with BRAF mutations, of which 58%(four out of seven) were having V600E, while others were reported with K601N, L597Q, and G469Vmutations [105]. A V600 mutation on exon 15 totals 50% of all BRAF mutants, while non-V600 BRAFmutations compose the remaining 50% [104].Recently, promising results from a Phase 2 clinical study with dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, hasshown efﬁcacy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with V600E BRAF mutation (Figure 1) [48].However, another study has found acquired resistance to dabrafenib in a patient after 8 months oftreatment. The primary mechanism responsible for this acquired resistance to dabrafenib in this patienthas been reported to be a G12D mutation in KRAS (Figure 1) [49]. Subsequent studies need to becarried out to further understand the therapeutic potential of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment ofNSCLC patients.Mutant BRAF in NSCLC is known to display resistance towards current inhibitors after prolongedtreatment. A BRAF oral inhibitor, vemurafenib, is effective in the treatment of advanced stagesof melanoma with the V600E mutation (Figure 1). However, in NSCLC, vemurafenib provideslittle to no response. The research conducted on inhibitors of mutant BRAF in NSCLC is limited;however, extensive work has been done on elucidating mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitorsin melanoma and may provide parallels to mechanisms in lung cancer. One study has shown thatelevated expression of alternate isoforms of RAF proteins (CRAF and ARAF) can continually stimulate',
            'the MAPK pathway despite BRAF inhibition, providing a mechanism of resistance (Figure 3) [50].Increased expression of MAP3K8 or COT can stimulate the MAPK pathway to bypass BRAF inhibition(Figure 3) [50,51]. The MAPK pathway and PI3K pathways also activate MCL-1, an antiapoptoticfactor. Parallel activation of the PI3K pathway may inhibit apoptosis in BRAF-mutant NSCLC throughMCL-1 despite inhibition of BRAF [50]. Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, is used in conjunction withvemurafenib to enhance the efﬁcacy (Figure 1). There have been promising results with the combinationof vemurafenib and trametinib with an increase in upregulation BIM, a pro-apoptotic protein, in V600Eand non-V600E cells which plays a major role in apoptosis [52]. In a recent study, the combination oftrametinib and dabrafenib resulted in increased growth inhibition by increased caspase3/7 activityin H166 and H508 cell lines. This combinatory treatment also increased ERK inhibition comparedto monotherapy [53]. These results suggest that combinatorial therapy may be an effective route toovercome resistance to treatment in BRAF-mutant NSCLC.'],

             'resistance to erlotinib. It has been proposed that IL-6 upregulation corresponds with increased levels ofSurvivin, BCL-X1, and BCL-2 in the erlotinib-resistant cells, which suggests that IL-6 somehow protectscells from apoptosis [60,61]. Another study demonstrated PIK3CA mutations in 5% of lung cancerpatients having EGFR mutations with acquired resistance. These mutations are reported to conferresistance by activating downstream targets such as AKT [62]. Our recent studies indicate that theactivation of alternative signaling pathways, such as PI3K/mTOR and Wnt, may also cause resistanceto EGFR TKIs in certain cell lines with wild-type EGFR; however, in cell lines with mutant EGFR,there is activation of the mTOR pathway. Activation of all these alternative pathways may contributeto EGFR and c-MET signaling, resulting in acquired resistance [63,64]. It has been shown that activeβ-catenin, which is a central downstream effector in the Wnt signaling cascade, is up-regulated inerlotinib-resistant cells, along with other proteins of the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, Wnt can causeactivation of EGFR and MAPK signaling via the Wnt/Fz/LRP pathway [64,65].It has also been found that the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is inappropriately activatedin EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC cells, though silenced in EGFR TKI sensitive cells, implicating Hhactivation in the development of EGFR TKI resistance via the induction of EMT and upregulationof the stem cell marker ABCG2 (Figure 2) [66]. The Hh pathway is a coordinator of many cellularprocesses, such as proliferation and differentiation, and it cooperates with the EGFR pathway duringembryonic development of mammals to coordinate stem cell proliferation [67]. Abrogation of thispathway resulted in increased sensitivity of resistant NSCLC cells to EGFR TKI treatment, as well asdecreased expression of ABCG2, further implicating its role in acquired resistance [66]. It has beenshown that the G776YVMA mutation in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) allows forthe phosphorylation of EGFR receptors even in the presence of EGFR TKIs [68].
