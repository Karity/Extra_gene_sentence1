29973561,Epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR is a transmembrane growth factor receptor whichplays an important role in regulating cell proliferation survival and growth [54],['EGFR']
29973561,Upon binding to epidermal growth factor EGF  EGFR dimerizes and autophosphorylates leading to activation of downstream intracellular signalingcascades such as RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR Figure 1 [24],['EGFR']
29973561,Mutations in EGFR thatresult in its constitutive activation are believed to be an important contributor to the tumorigenesis ofmany cancer types including lung cancer,['EGFR']
29973561,It has been reported that sensitizing mutations in the EGFRtyrosine kinase TK domain at exons 18–21 occur in about 15–18% of NSCLC patients among whichthe L858R point mutation in exon 21 and a deletion in exon 19 residues 747–750 constitute about 40%and 45% of EGFR mutations respectively [55],['EGFR']
29973561,Exon 20 insertions account for roughly 9% of activatingEGFR mutations and prognosis for NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertion mutant EGFR is generallyquite poor [56],['EGFR']

29973561,Tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs have been developed to inhibit mutated EGFR and its constitutive activation,['EGFR']
29973561,The first generation of EGFR TKIs includes erlotinib and gefitinib,['EGFR']
29973561,They reduce aberrant EGFR signaling via reversible inhibition of the ATP-binding pocket in the EGFR kinase domain,['EGFR']
29973561,Unfortunately the development of TKI resistance is common after prolonged use of these EGFR TKIs [9],['EGFR']
29973561,One major mechanism for the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is the development of the T790M secondary mutation within the EGFR kinase domain,['EGFR']
29973561,The bulkier methionine residue at position 790 sterically hinders its interaction with TKIs and increases affinity for ATP thus reducing inhibitor binding to the EGFR kinase domain while preserving catalytic activity [10],['EGFR']
29973561,Additional secondary mutations such as D761Y T854A and L747S Figure 1 are reported to arise subsequently to the EGFR TKI sensitizing L858R mutation and cause resistance [11],['EGFR']
29973561,In cell lines which are intrinsically resistant due to the presence of mutated EGFR increased activity of TGF-β which is often produced during an inflammatory response has been shown to initiate transition to mesenchymal-like cell morphology accompanied by increased mobility invasiveness and resistance to erlotinib [60],['EGFR']

29973561,Another study demonstrated PIK3CA mutations in 5% of lung cancerpatients having EGFR mutations with acquired resistance,['EGFR']
29973561,These mutations are reported to conferresistance by activating downstream targets such as AKT [62],['AKT']
29973561,Our recent studies indicate that theactivation of alternative signaling pathways such as PI3K mTOR and Wnt may also cause resistanceto EGFR TKIs in certain cell lines with wild-type EGFR; however in cell lines with mutant EGFR there is activation of the mTOR pathway,"['EGFR', 'PI3K']"
29973561,Activation of all these alternative pathways may contributeto EGFR and c-MET signaling resulting in acquired resistance [63 64],['EGFR']
29973561,Furthermore Wnt can causeactivation of EGFR and MAPK signaling via the Wnt Fz LRP pathway [64 65],['EGFR']
29973561,It has also been found that the hedgehog Hh signaling pathway is inappropriately activatedin EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC cells though silenced in EGFR TKI sensitive cells implicating Hhactivation in the development of EGFR TKI resistance via the induction of EMT and upregulationof the stem cell marker ABCG2 Figure 2 [66],['EGFR']
29973561,The Hh pathway is a coordinator of many cellularprocesses such as proliferation and differentiation and it cooperates with the EGFR pathway duringembryonic development of mammals to coordinate stem cell proliferation [67],['EGFR']
29973561,Abrogation of thispathway resulted in increased sensitivity of resistant NSCLC cells to EGFR TKI treatment as well asdecreased expression of ABCG2 further implicating its role in acquired resistance [66],['EGFR']
29973561,It has beenshown that the G776YVMA mutation in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 allows forthe phosphorylation of EGFR receptors even in the presence of EGFR TKIs [68],['EGFR']
29973561,The knockdownof HER2 restored sensitivity to EGFR TKIs in H1781 lung cancer cells which have the G776YVMA,['EGFR']
29973561,mutation suggesting that inhibition of HER2 may prove a promising target to bypass EGFR TKIresistance [68],['EGFR']
29973561,Inappropriate ampliﬁcation of MET a gene that codes for an epithelial RTK thatactivates signaling of the MAPK PI3K and SRC pathways upon binding by its ligand hepatocytegrowth factor HGF [69] stimulates the AKT pathway and is also a major contributor to EGFR TKIsecondary resistance Figure 1,"['EGFR', 'AKT', 'PI3K']"
29973561,In fact MET gene ampliﬁcation is shown to beone of the most relevant mechanisms responsible for the acquired resistance against EGFR TKIs Figure 2 [70],['EGFR']
29973561,Crosstalk between c-MET and EGFR signaling pathways has also been observed [71 72],['EGFR']
29973561,have demonstrated that TKIs against c-MET and EGFR have a synergistic inhibitoryeffect on proliferation [72],['EGFR']
29973561,More speciﬁcally MET ampliﬁcation has been shown topromote geﬁtinib resistance by activating PI3K through ERBB3 HER3 despite EGFR inhibition viageﬁtinib [70],"['EGFR', 'PI3K']"
29973561,Another study found inhibition of c-MET in MET-ampliﬁed NSCLC led to activationof the EGFR pathway [74],['EGFR']
29973561,Thus EGFR c-MET combination therapy could be a possible strategy toovercome c-MET resistance [75],['EGFR']
29973561,A recent study conducted by our laboratory found upregulation ofmTOR and Wnt signaling proteins in c-MET EGFR resistant NSCLC cell lines implying the role ofalternative cell signaling pathways in TKI resistance [63],['EGFR']
29973561,This suggests that a combination of Wnt andmTOR inhibitors with c-MET or EGFR inhibitors may improve the prognosis in NSCLC,['EGFR']
29973561,Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor IGF-1R is another RTK whose activation could contribute to acquired EGFR TKI resistance,['EGFR']
29973561,IGF-1R has thepotential to dimerize with EGFR after treatment with erlotinib transducing signals to the AKT andMAPK signaling pathways that would otherwise be silenced by erlotinib Figure 1,"['EGFR', 'AKT']"
29973561,Inhibition ofIGF-1R has been shown to enhance the effects of ﬁrst generation EGFR TKIs providing a possibleroute to overcome resistance [76],['EGFR']
29973561,EMT MET amplification and IGF-1R confer resistance to EGFR TKIs,['EGFR']
29973561,Dimerization with IGF-1R allows activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways despite EGFR inhibition,"['EGFR', 'PI3K']"
29973561,MET amplification allows phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of downstream signaling,['EGFR']
29973561,Activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathways promote EMT which may confer resistance to EGFR TKIs,['EGFR']
29973561,Metformin decreases IL-6 signaling reverses EMT and decreases activation of STAT3 and AKT [61 78],['AKT']
29973561,Clinical trials are currently being done to study Metformin in combinatory treatments with an assortment of molecularly targeted therapies including EGFR inhibitors as well as its effect on overall survival and treatment-related toxicity in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients,['EGFR']
29973561,The second-generation EGFR TKI afatinib is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR,['EGFR']
29973561,It was shown to have an EC50 against EGFR with the T790M mutation at a concentration of 9 nM [12] suggesting its potential to overcome TKI resistance due to the T790M mutation,['EGFR']
29973561,EMT MET ampliﬁcation and IGF-1R confer resistance to EGFR TKIs,['EGFR']
29973561,Dimerization with IGF-1R allows activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways despite EGFR inhibition,"['EGFR', 'PI3K']"

29973561,The second-generation EGFR TKI afatinib is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR,['EGFR']
29973561,It was shown tohave an EC50 against EGFR with the T790M mutation at a concentration of 9 nM [12] suggesting itspotential to overcome TKI resistance due to the T790M mutation,['EGFR']
29973561,In contrast to erlotinib and geﬁtinib which solely bind to the ATP-binding site of EGFR afatinib also forms covalent bonds with cysteine 797and the cysteine residues of HER2 and ErbB-4 thus further inhibiting phosphorylation of EGFR [13],['EGFR']
29973561,Six of the 12 patients had tumor size reductions; three achieved durable stabledisease including one with EGFR exon 19 and T790M mutations [12],['EGFR']
29973561,Third generation TKIs have beendesigned to target both EGFR with activating mutations and T790M resistance mutation in NSCLCpatients,['EGFR']
29973561,Recently the FDA has approved osimertinib Tagrisso or AZD9291 a third-generation EGFRTKI as a breakthrough treatment for NSCLC patients whose tumors have a T790M mutation and whosedisease has worsened after treatment with other EGFR inhibitors,['EGFR']
29973561,Phase 1 clinical trials of osimertinibdemonstrated a response rate of 61% and a disease control rate of 95% in advanced lung cancer patientswith prevailing cancer progression after EGFR TKI treatment [14],['EGFR']
29973561,A recent Phase III FLAURA trial demonstrated thesuperiority of osimertinib over ﬁrst-generation EGFR inhibitors geﬁtinib and erlotinib as a ﬁrst-linetreatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC,['EGFR']
29973561,Although mutant EGFR NSCLC patients bearing exon 20 insertions are generallyunresponsive to ﬁrst-line TKI therapy recent studies suggest that osimertinib may prove effective asa therapy for patients with these activating mutations,['EGFR']
29973561,However resistance to this TKI has alreadybeen reported arising via mutations in the C797 EGFR codon and EGFR G796D as well as ampliﬁedHER2 and MET signaling [18–20],['EGFR']
29973561,Another study demonstrated high levels of MET ampliﬁcation seen intumor biopsies of a mutant T790M EGFR NSCLC patient following osimertinib treatment,['EGFR']
29973561,Another third generation TKI rociletinib was designed toinhibit the activating EGFR mutation and the T790M resistance mutation with a focus on sparingwild-type EGFR,['EGFR']
29973561,This design was shown to be effective in preclinical models in which rociletinibwas found to have signiﬁcantly less activity against wild-type EGFR than the early-generation TKIscurrently being used clinically as well as AZD9291 [21],['EGFR']
29973561,A fourth generation TKI EAI045 has been developed as a novel EGFR inhibitor to overcome bothC797 and T790M mutations that confer resistance to third generation inhibitors,['EGFR']
29973561,other EGFR TKIs acts via allosteric inhibition rather than competitive inhibition of the ATP-bindingsite,['EGFR']
29973561,The growth inhibitory activity of EAI045 increases when combined with cetuximab an EGFRinhibitor that prevents EGFR from dimerizing,['EGFR']
29973561,Additionally since dimerization-defective independent mutants were markedly more sensitive to EAI045 it ishypothesized that EAI045 acts upon a single component of the EGFR dimer [20 23],['EGFR']
29973561,Thus EAI045treatment appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy in NSCLC patients with resistance to ﬁrst second and third generation EGFR TKIs,['EGFR']
29973561,Patients being treated with EGFR inhibitors will requirecontinual assessment of progression of lung cancer in order to study how these patients becomeresistant to therapy and to develop strategies to prevent resistance,['EGFR']
29973561,Some other studiesfocusing on the mechanism of resistance to crizotinib have shown involvement of mutations in EGFRand KRAS [27] activation of the ErbB family through phosphorylation [26] EMT [91] activation of the,['KRAS']
29973561,A recent study also performed a multi-phospho-RTK antibody array to screen for secondary RTKinvolvement in ALK inhibitor resistance within two crizotinib-resistant and one TAE684-resistantcell line further implicating EGFR IGF-1R and HER as well as MET in acquired ALK inhibitorresistance [94],['EGFR']
29973561,A few other studies have reported that EGFR ligands [98] and hypoxia-induced EMT conferresistance to alectinib [91],['EGFR']
29973561,This studyalso demonstrates that a combination of both ALK and the RAS-MAPK component MEK inhibitorscould be a potential approach to overcome resistance and improve the prognosis of ALK-positive lungcancer [99],['MEK']
29973561,BRAF v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 is a member of the RAFserine threonine protein kinases family,['BRAF']
29973561,BRAF encodes for a RAF kinase that signals downstreamof RAS to activate the MAPK pathway which causes uncontrolled growth and differentiation uponmutation [103],['BRAF']
29973561,BRAF is the most commonly mutated gene in melanoma; however BRAF mutationshave also been shown to be associated with NSCLC with a frequency of approximately 2–3% of cases,['BRAF']
29973561,A study reported BRAF mutations in18 3% out of 697 patients with lung adenocarcinoma,['BRAF']
29973561,V600E BRAF mutation was observed in 50% ofthese 18 patients while G469A and D594G were found in 39% and 11% respectively [104],['BRAF']
