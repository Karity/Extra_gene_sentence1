../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,Akt SIGNALING AS A TARGET OF TIG
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,Akt also known as protein kinase B PKB  belongs toan evolutionarily conserved serine-protein kinase family andparticipates in cell homeostasis maintenance by regulatingnumerous downstream eﬀectors
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,The Akt family mainly containsthree members Akt1 PKBα  Akt2 PKBβ  and Akt3 PKBγ  which share more than 80% structure homology
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,Sinceits discovery numerous eﬀorts have been made to clarifythe mechanism of Akt activation
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,Studies have indicated thatthe Akt signaling pathway could be activated by receptortyrosine kinases RTKs  including insulin-like growth factor 1receptor IGF-1R  epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and others Manning and Cantley 2007
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,Then the accumulation of PIP3 activates Akt by phosphorylationmodiﬁcation at two regulatory sites Thr308 and Ser473 Cantley
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,In addition to RTKs Akt activity can be modulatedby lipid and protein phosphatases such as phosphatase andtensin homolog PTEN and protein phosphatase 2A PP2A
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,PTEN is a negative modulator of the Akt signaling pathway and inhibition of PTEN by a small-molecule inhibitor couldsigniﬁcantly activate Akt Shojaee et al
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,Similarly PP2Acan down-regulate Akt activation by directly promoting Thr308dephosphorylation Liu et al
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,Additionally once Akt islocked in the active conﬁrmation it can regulate more than100 down-stream factors that are involved in diverse cellularfunctions including cell proliferation apoptosis metabolism and so on
../abc\AKT\27994551_page3_338_1.jpg,These direct substrates of Akt all share a consensusphosphorylated minimal motif R-X-R-X-X-pS pT Carmonaet al

../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,AKT as one of the major downstream effectorsof PI3K plays a vital role in the promotion of cell proliferation and preventing the cellfrom entering the apoptotic pathway by interacting with caspase-9 and Bcl2 [124]
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,The inactivation of PTEN and RAS also can stimulate AKT activation and excessiveactivation of AKT was suggested to be a poor prognostic factor for early stage NSCLCpatients [61]
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,However ubiquitination is completely essential for AKT signaling acti-vation
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,For instance K63-linked ubiquitination mediated by NEDD4–1 [125] Skp2[59] and TRAF6 [59 126] which itself could be negatively mediated by c-Cbl [127] induces AKT activation via promoting plasma membrane translocation and nucleartranslocation
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,Converse evidence suggests that TRAF4 but not Skp2 is required forAKT K63 ubiquitination and promotes EGF-induced AKT membrane recruitment inhuman lung cancer cells to induce tumorigenic properties [60] but TRAF6 is un-necessary for EGF-induced AKT activation [59 60]
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,In contrast K48-linked ubiquiti-nation mediated by CHIP BRCA1 MULAN and TTC3 triggers the proteasomaldegradation of phosphorylated AKT to terminate its activation [29 111 128–130]
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,Nevertheless the ubiquitination of AKT can be reversed by CYLD which is a deubi-quitinating enzyme and plays a tumor suppressor role in inhibiting AKT activity byremoving AKT K63-linked ubiquitin chains and serves as a negative regulator forAKT-mediated tumorigenesis or lung fibrosis [131] Fig
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,Loss of PTEN increases the phosphorylation of AKT and de-regulates PI3K signaling which in turn enhances cell survival [138–141]
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,On the other hand PTMs of PTEN that regulate its enzymatic activity interaction with other proteins and subcellular localization have been strongly impli-cated in the regulation of the PI3K AKT pathway [57 135 142 143]
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,The p110 subunit of PI3K catalyzes the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 which recruits AKT to the plasma membrane for activation through PDK1 and PDK2
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,In that process activation of AKT is inhibited by PTEN through conversion of PIP3 to PIP2 to restraint the downstream events i
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,K48-linked polyubiquitination on phosphorylated AKT is triggered by E3 ligases CHIP BRCA1 MULAN or TTC3 for proteasome degradation but K63-linked AKT is induced by NEDD4–1 Skp2 and TRAF6 to mediate its nuclear localization for further activation of the PI3K-AKT signal
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,However TRAF4 is the main effector for AKT K63-linked ubiquitination and promotes EGF-induced AKT membrane recruitment in human lung cancer cells to induce tumorigenic properties

../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,Meanwhile activated mTORC1 can enhance the RAF-ERK signaling through feedback inhibition of PI3K but not of AKT or mTORC2
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,More interestingly ataxin-3 as one member of the Josephin familyDUBs can enhance the transcription level of PTEN probably through stabilizing itsspecific transcriptional activators to down-regulate AKT phosphorylation and PI3Ksignaling in NSCLC [143]

../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,The activity of mTORC1 can be regu-lated through the function of tuberous sclerosis complex TSC1 and TSC2 activatedby membrane localized AKT and enhances the GTPase activity of the mTOR activatorRheb [62 153] thereby promoting cell growth via up-regulation of protein synthesisthrough activation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6 kinase [63 154] Fig
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,However inhibitionof mTORC1 can lead to RAS-MEK-ERK activation through PI3K-dependent feedbackbut not mTORC2 AKT or targets of downstream of AKT in human cancer [62] whichreveals an alternative signal whereby phosphorylation at Ser259 of Raf by AKT deacti-vated and inhibited the signal cascade of RAS-MEK-ERK [155] Fig
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,Like AKT ubiquitination also plays a key role in regulation of the mTOR pathway
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,Moreover Rictor as an essential component of mTORC2could also be directly mediated by Fbxw7 for ubiquitination and proteasome degrad-ation which thereby impairs the AKT activation and downstream signaling [159]
../abc\AKT\31988639_page9_694_1.jpg,In addition UCH-L1 as a ubiquitin hydrolase of Raptor hasa critical role in regulation of the dichotomy between mTORC1 and mTORC2 signal-ing and it impairs mTORC1 activity toward S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 while increasingmTORC2 activity toward AKT [161] Fig

../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,However resistance to this TKI has alreadybeen reported arising via mutations in the C797 EGFR codon and EGFR G796D as well as ampliﬁedHER2 and MET signaling [18–20]
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,Another study demonstrated high levels of MET ampliﬁcation seen intumor biopsies of a mutant T790M EGFR NSCLC patient following osimertinib treatment
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,Another third generation TKI rociletinib was designed toinhibit the activating EGFR mutation and the T790M resistance mutation with a focus on sparingwild-type EGFR
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,This design was shown to be effective in preclinical models in which rociletinibwas found to have signiﬁcantly less activity against wild-type EGFR than the early-generation TKIscurrently being used clinically as well as AZD9291 [21]
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,A fourth generation TKI EAI045 has been developed as a novel EGFR inhibitor to overcome bothC797 and T790M mutations that confer resistance to third generation inhibitors
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,other EGFR TKIs acts via allosteric inhibition rather than competitive inhibition of the ATP-bindingsite
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,The growth inhibitory activity of EAI045 increases when combined with cetuximab an EGFRinhibitor that prevents EGFR from dimerizing
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,Additionally since dimerization-defective independent mutants were markedly more sensitive to EAI045 it ishypothesized that EAI045 acts upon a single component of the EGFR dimer [20 23]
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,Thus EAI045treatment appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy in NSCLC patients with resistance to ﬁrst second and third generation EGFR TKIs
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,Patients being treated with EGFR inhibitors will requirecontinual assessment of progression of lung cancer in order to study how these patients becomeresistant to therapy and to develop strategies to prevent resistance
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,A recent study also performed a multi-phospho-RTK antibody array to screen for secondary RTKinvolvement in ALK inhibitor resistance within two crizotinib-resistant and one TAE684-resistantcell line further implicating EGFR IGF-1R and HER as well as MET in acquired ALK inhibitorresistance [94]
../abc\EGFR\29973561_page4_305_1.jpg,A few other studies have reported that EGFR ligands [98] and hypoxia-induced EMT conferresistance to alectinib [91]

../abc\EGFR\30060526_page55_1599_0.jpg,The analysis of gene mutationsshowed that eighteen genes were currently mutated: TP53 was the most frequently mutated 46% ;KRAS mutations 33% were mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations 14% ; another group of genesfrequently mutated is represented by BRAF 10%  PIK3CA 7%  MET 7% and RT1 a small GTPase 2% ; a group of tumor suppressor genes including STK11 17%  KEAP1 17%  NF1 11%  RB1 4% and CDKN2A 4%  was also frequently mutated; another group of frequent mutations involve a set ofchromatin modifying genes such as SETD2 9%  ARID1A 7% and SMARCA4 6% was frequentlymutated as well as the two RNA splicing genes RBM10 8% and U2AF1 3% ; ﬁnally mutations of theMax-interacting gene MGA mutationally exclusive with MYC focal ampliﬁcations are observed in 8%of patients [13]
../abc\EGFR\30060526_page55_1599_0.jpg,Somatic copy number alterations involve ampliﬁcations of the NKX2-1 TERT MDM2 KRAS EGFR MET CCNE1 CCND1 TERC and MECOM while CDKN2A gene was the most frequentlydeleted [12]
../abc\EGFR\30060526_page55_1599_0.jpg,An overall view ofthe mutational status of the 230 adenocarcinoma patients showed that 62% of them display activatingmutations in known driver oncogenes such as EGFR KRES BRAF mutations ALK ROS1 and RETfusions  the remaining 38% of patients was without any apparent RTK RAS RAF oncogene mutation
../abc\EGFR\30060526_page55_1599_0.jpg,The subtypes were associatedwith genomic alterations: the proximal proliferative subtype was enriched for KRAS mutations KEAP1 mutations and with inactivation of the tumor suppressor STK11; the proximal inﬂammatorysubtype was characterized by mutations of TP53 and NF1 and by solid histopathology; the terminalrespiratory unit associated with a more favorable prognosis was associated with EGFR mutationsand fusions [13 14]

../abc\EGFR\30060526_page55_1599_0.jpg,These observations suggest that the KLF6 FOXO1 transcriptionalnetwork may represent an important EGFR oncogenic signaling pathway that can be targeted for thetreatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma
../abc\EGFR\30060526_page55_1599_0.jpg,Interestingly a recent study compared the genomic abnormalities observed in lungadenocarcinomas driven by mutant KRAS or EGFR and by overexpression of MYC; tumors frommodels driven by strong cancer drivers such as mutant EGFR and KRAS harbored few mutations inknown cancer genes whereas tumors driven by MYC acquired recurrent clonal KRAS mutations

../abc\PI3K\25557115_page0_125_0.jpg,Currently clinical trials are being conducted to study the therapeutic effects of MEK and PI3K inhibitors in cancer patients harbor-ing RAS mutations[2]
../abc\PI3K\25557115_page0_125_0.jpg,Interestingly it was observed that NSCLC cell lines carrying the KRAS G12C or G12V muta-tion have higher RAL GTPase activities and lower PI3K AKT or RAF-MEK-ERK pathway activation compared with cell lines carrying other KRAS mutations Figure 3 or wild-type KRAS[20]
../abc\PI3K\25557115_page0_125_0.jpg,Another common KRAS mutation at codon 12 the glycine to aspar-tate G12D mutation was shown to predominantly activate the PI3K AKT pathway[20] Figure 3
../abc\PI3K\25557115_page0_125_0.jpg,Since KRAS directly binds to PI3K this pathway can be activated irrespective of KRAS dimer forma-tion[20]

../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Physiologically PTEN patrols in proximity to this phosphorylation event preservinghomeostasis by removing a phosphate group from PIP3 and converting it back to the PIP2 inactive state

../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Most of the relevant studies have described PTEN protein loss in more than 40%of NSCLC cases while some of them suggested correlation with smoking status SQLC histology

../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Also PTEN loss was associated with SQLC
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,In vitro NSCLC models harboring PTEN loss were sensitive toPI3K inhibition [77]
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,PTEN expression was reported totally absent in 41
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,However PTEN loss was correlated with shorter disease-free survival DFS only in LUAD patients
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,6% 7 124 showed PTEN deletionand all were PTEN negative by IHC
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Interestingly PTEN loss in never smokers was detected only in26% but without signiﬁcant diﬀerence from smokers [78]

../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,The ﬁndings also suggested anegative correlation between p-AktS473 and PTEN and poor survival for p-AktS473 positive PTENnegative [80]
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,IHC analysis of more than 1000 patients in two cohorts of predominantly early stageNSCLC cases LUAD and SQLC  performed in independent laboratories conﬁrmed that cytoplasmicPI3Kβ overexpression and PTEN low or negative expression were signiﬁcantly more prevalent inSQLC than LUAD
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Moreover the SQLC subtype was found to be more frequently correlated withsimultaneous PI3Kβ overexpression and inverse expression of PTEN than LUAD patients
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,500 NSCLCpatients concluded that decreased PTEN expression detected by IHC was associated with shorteroverall survival OS  DFS and PFS [86]
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Additionally other mechanisms which have been associated with EGFR TKIsresistance in NSCLC patients involve PTEN loss and the activation of PI3K mTOR signaling [92]

../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Moreover genetic silencing of PTENin cell lines conferred resistance to geﬁtinib supporting the notion that PTEN expression is associatedwith EGFR TKI sensitivity [93]
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,After resection of the right lobe the tissue wassubjected to mutation analysis which revealed a PTEN mutation but no EGFR mutations [94]

../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Interestingly onlyconcomitant NEDD4 genetic deletion and PTEN transfection in the PTEN-deﬁcient H1640 resistantcells managed to increase signiﬁcantly the resistance to erlotinib indicating that NEDD4-mediatedresistance mechanism relies on PTEN presence and subsequent degradation [99]
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,previously methylation of the PTEN promoter could be found in EGFR TKIs resistant cell lines

../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Interestingly in a study where 169 NSCLC patients harbored EGFR-sensitivemutations those that had concurrent PTEN deletion showed a more dismal PFS and OS compared tothose with intact PTEN
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,In addition PTEN deletion and low PTEN protein expression are strong andindependent predictors of worse PFS in EGFR-TKI treated NSCLC patients [101]
../abc\PTEN\31404976_page2_190_3.jpg,Moreover high PTENexpression seems to contribute to prolonged survival in geﬁtinib-treated NSCLC patients while EGFRmutant patients with concomitant elevated PTEN expression showed the longest survival compared toother subgroups [102]
