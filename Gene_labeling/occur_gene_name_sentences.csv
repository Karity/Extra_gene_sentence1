25477004,Mechanism of Notch signaling in regulating EMT,['EMT']
25477004,It was first revealed that Notch activity in-duced EMT was required for cardiac valve and cushion for-mationduringheartdevelopment involvingdown-regulation of epithelial markers E-cadherin and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers snail [65 66],['EMT']
25477004,Mean-while inactivation of Notch signaling by a γ-secretase in-hibitor could reverse the EMT process [67],['EMT']
25477004,Interestingly over-expression of Jagged1 could trigger repression of E-cadherin in human kidney epithelial cells suggestingJagged-1 is a necessary element of Notch signaling forpromoting EMT [68],['EMT']
25477004,In EMT processes Notch cross-talks with several transcription and growth factors rele-vant to EMT including Snail Slug TGF-β FGF andPDGF [21 69],['EMT']
25477004,The reduc-tion of E-cadherin expression reduces the cell-cell junc-tion and leads to destabilization of the epithelial structure which is an initial step in EMT,['EMT']
25477004,On thecontrary inactivation of Notch attenuated the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression and decreased Snailexpression suggesting a direct role for Notch signaling viaSnail in the induction of EMT [71],['EMT']
25477004,By recruitment ofhypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α Notch sig-naling pathway could also increase Snail expression topromote EMT through a sophisticated framework [72],['EMT']
25477004,Interestingly the inhibition of COX-2 could reverse theability of Notch1 to induce EMT suggesting that Notch isdependent on COX2 to mediate pro-metastasis via Snail E-cadherin in EMT [73],['EMT']
25477004,partial reversal of EMT by decreased expressions of Snail Slug ZEB1 vimentin and nuclear factor-kappaB showingslug was essential for Notch-mediated EMT [75],['EMT']
25477004,Correspondingly inhibition ofZEB1 reverses EMT and chemo-resistance in docetaxel-refract human lung adenocarcinoma cell line [79],['EMT']
25477004,It is concluded that inter-action of Notch-miR-200-ZEB1 loop governed EMT andmetastatic capacity,['EMT']
25477004,The transforming growth factor beta TGF-β  a ubiqui-tous cytokine with profound growth inhibitory effects onepithelial and other tissues orchestrates an intricate sig-naling network that is crucial to determine cell fate dif-ferentiation proliferation and motile leading to not onlytumour suppression but also EMT [82],['EMT']
25477004,Initiated by ligand-receptor binding TGF-βmediates the interaction of SMAD to the promoters ofSnail contributing to the development of EMT in NSCLC[83 84],['EMT']
25477004,TGF-β induced EMT could be blocked by knockdown of Hey-1 or jagged-1 and by pharmacological inacti-vation of Notch indicating the key role of Notch signalingin TGF-beta-induced EMT [85],['EMT']
25477004,However in cultured limbal progenitorcells Notch prevents TGF-β-assisted EMT through the in-duction of Smad7 [87],['EMT']
25477004,Given theimportance of Notch and cyclin D1 in tumorigenesis it isnot surprising that Notch pathway would participate inregulation of cyclin D1-mediated EMT,['EMT']

25477004,Theelevated expression of Notch-1 could directly suppress p21Waf1 Cipl accompanied with the increasing of cyclin D1 giving rise to the EMT phenotype,['EMT']
25477004,These findings suggest that the aggressive behaviorcaused by cyclinD1 might be driven by the mis-expressionof Notch pathway in NSCLC which finally down regulatesp21 Waf1 Cipl and promotes the EMT phenotype [71],['EMT']
25477004,For instance nanoparticle NP technology has been applied to deliver specificsiRNA to knockdown Notch1 to arrest tumor growth andreverse EMT by the up-regulation of miR-200a and down-regulation of the transcription factors ZEB1 ZEB2 Snailand Slug [113],['EMT']

25557115,For example mutant KRAS with either a glycine to cysteine G12C or glycine to valine G12V muta-tion at codon 12 preferentially binds to RAL guanine nucleo-tide dissociation stimulator RALGDS  a RAL GTPase-specific GEF whereas KRAS harboring a glycine to aspartate mutation at codon 12 G12D has higher affinity for phosphatidylino-sitol 3-kinase PI3K [20],['RAL']
25557115,These recent studies have brought to light the need to clarify the impact of such KRAS mutations on the RAL GTPase signaling pathway,['RAL']
25557115,The RAL GTPase family and effectors,['RAL']
25557115,RAL GTPase falls under the RAS family of GTPases,['RAL']
25557115,RAL shares a high degree of sequence similarity with the three RAS genes hence the name RAL RAS-like [1],['RAL']
25557115,The RAL GTPase sub-family comprises the two isoforms RALA and RALB which share high sequence homology[21],['RAL']
25557115,"RAL GTPase can be activated by six GEFs RALGEFs  RALGDS RGL RGL2 Rlf, RGL3 RALGPS1 and RALGPS2 and inactivated by two GAPs RALGAP1 and RALGAP2[22 23]",['RAL']
25557115,RALGEFs and RAL play a dominant role in the RAS-mediated transformation of several different immor-talized human cell lines as well as in a RAS-driven tumor model[24 25],['RAL']
25557115,RAL proteins mediate various cellular activities including filopodia formation membrane ruffling glycolysis autoph-agy secretion the maintenance of polarity apoptosis and transcription[21 26] Figure 2,['RAL']
25557115,Of all the RAL effectors the most exten-sively studied are RALBP1 and the members of the exocyst complex Sec5 and Exo84[26],"['RALBP1', 'RAL']"
25557115,Other RAL effectors include Fila-min PLD1 and ZONAB[26],['RAL']
25557115,RALBP1 has GAP activity for RAC CDC42 proteins,['RALBP1']
25557115,In this way RALBP1 is important for actin dynamics filopodia formation and membrane ruffling[1 26 27] thereby contributing to cancer cell adhesion invasion and migration,['RALBP1']
25557115,RALBP1 is critical for the migration of bladder and prostate cancer cells which is partly independent of its interaction with RAL[28],['RALBP1']
25557115,RALBP1 is also important for endocytosis including receptor-mediated endocytosis of proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor insulin receptor and transferrin receptor through its interactions with POB1 Reps1 and AP2[29–31],['RALBP1']
25557115,The involvement of RALBP1 in receptor endocytosis points to the prominence of RAL in signal transduction by these receptors which regulate various cellular processes such as survival and proliferation[32 33],"['RALBP1', 'RAL']"
25557115,RALBP1 has also been identified as a non-ABC transporter that causes resistance to chemothera-peutic drugs[34],['RALBP1']
25557115,RALBP1 is known to cause resistance to anthracycline derivatives such as doxorubicin and glutathione conjugates by increasing their efflux from cells in an ATP-,['RALBP1']
25557115,This transporter activity of RALBP1 helps to protect cancer cells from cytotoxic drugs and cel-lular stress[34],['RALBP1']
25557115,RALBP1 also induces mitochondrial fission by promoting the phosphorylation of the GTPase DRP1 by CyclinB CDK1 and facilitating the recruitment of DRP1 to mitochondrial membranes[37],['RALBP1']
25557115,The absence of RALA-depen-dent RALBP1 activation leads to the improper segregation of mitochondria to daughter cells during cell division result-ing in improper cellular metabolic activity including cellular ATP production which assists cell growth[37],['RALBP1']
25557115,RALBP1 is also known to promote invadopodia formation upon activation by RALB[38],['RALBP1']
25557115,RALBP1 ATPase function is required for invadopodia forma-tion[38],['RALBP1']
25557115,RAL also interacts with ZONAB to regulate cellular tran-scription which gives rise to cellular proliferative signaling[48],['RAL']
25557115,PLD1 is another important effector of RAL GTPase; PLD1 plays a role in membrane trafficking and as a signaling molecule[50],['RAL']

25557115,Increased expression and activation of the RAL isoforms are observed in various tumor types compared with normal tis-sues as well as in high-stage and high-grade tumors signify-ing their importance in tumorigenesis[55–59],['RAL']
25557115,In most cancer models RALA has been established as the dominant RAL isoform and the main driver of tumor progression and metas-tasis,['RAL']
25557115,However the RAL effectors responsible for melanoma tumor growth have not been stud-ied[59],['RAL']
25557115,RALBP1 was established as the primary RALA effector in A549 cells[60],['RALBP1']
25557115,Our lab used a panel of 14 NSCLC cell lines and showed that RALA and RALB had redundant functions in NSCLC tumor growth and that RALBP1 is the pri-mary effector driving this phenotype[55],['RALBP1']
25557115,Our lab further devel-oped the first known RAL inhibitors and showed that these small molecule drugs inhibited the growth of NSCLC cell lines in vitro and in vivo by limiting the binding of RALBP1 to both RALA and RALB[61],"['RALBP1', 'RAL']"
25557115,RALA and RALB have also been shown to provide protection against ionizing radiation via the effectors RALBP1 and Sec5 in pan-creatic cancer cell lines[63],['RALBP1']
25557115,Both RAL isoforms have important functions in the growth and metastasis of bladder cancer[28 64 65],['RAL']
25557115,RALBP1 has been identified as the main RAL effector in the majority of these tumors,"['RALBP1', 'RAL']"
25557115,RAL-driven colorec-tal cancer growth has been attributed to RALBP1 Sec5 and Exo84[66],['RALBP1']
25557115,Sec5 and Exo84 have been identified as important RAL effectors in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin[68],['RAL']
25557115,A tran-scriptional signature was recently developed to report cellular RAL activity levels [74],['RAL']
25557115,This RAL signature was predictive,['RAL']
25557115,of cancer patient outcomes indicating for the first time that the genes and pathways regulated by RAL are important for tumor formation and progression in cancer patients [74],['RAL']
25557115,Dependency of RAL activity on RAS mutation,['RAL']
25557115,Interestingly it was observed that NSCLC cell lines carrying the KRAS G12C or G12V muta-tion have higher RAL GTPase activities and lower PI3K AKT or RAF-MEK-ERK pathway activation compared with cell lines carrying other KRAS mutations Figure 3 or wild-type KRAS[20],"['AKT', 'RAL', 'PI3K']"
25557115,It is known that KRAS homodimer formation is important for RAL GTPase activation via RALGDS binding to KRAS[75],['RAL']
25557115,Ihle et al used extensive molecular modeling to show that in case of the KRAS G12C mutation the smaller cysteine residue allows for KRAS homodimer formation RALGDS binding and subsequent RAL activation[20],['RAL']
25557115,Another common KRAS mutation at codon 12 the glycine to aspar-tate G12D mutation was shown to predominantly activate the PI3K AKT pathway[20] Figure 3,"['AKT', 'PI3K']"
25557115,Aspartate is a bulkier amino acid than glycine G12D mutation prevents KRAS homodimer formation via steric hindrance; thus RAL activa-tion is prevented[20],['RAL']
25557115,Since KRAS directly binds to PI3K this pathway can be activated irrespective of KRAS dimer forma-tion[20],['PI3K']
25557115,Since RAL membrane expression is associated with RAL activity we can speculate that patients with KRAS mutations have high RAL activity[55],['RAL']
25557115,The authors showed that there was no difference in RAL expression between patients harboring KRAS transition muta-tions including G12D compared to patients carrying KRAS transversion mutations such as G12C and G12V[76],['RAL']
25557115,Similarly AKT was also not differentially expressed between patients carrying KRAS transition and transversion mutations[76],['AKT']
25557115,Using in vitro and in vivo functional assays our lab estab-lished that both RAL isoforms are required for the growth of NSCLC cells carrying the KRAS G12C mutation compared with cells carrying other KRAS mutations and wild-type KRAS[55],['RAL']
25557115,NSCLC cell lines that are wild-type for KRAS or that carry other mutations showed moderate to no inhibition in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth assays upon the loss of the RAL GTPases[55],['RAL']
25557115,Our study also showed that overexpres-sion of the KRAS G12C mutant in the KRAS-wild-type cell line H2228 increased the activation of RAL and the depen-dency of the cells on RAL GTPases for anchorage-independent growth[55],['RAL']
25557115,Thus we used detailed functional analysis to vali-date that the KRAS G12C mutation indeed drives tumorigene-sis predominantly via RAL GTPases,['RAL']
25557115,Since KRAS G12C and G12V are the most common RAS muta-tions found in NSCLC these studies point to the importance of RAL in driving tumor growth downstream of KRAS in NSCLC,['RAL']
25557115,In pancreatic cancers RAL GTPase was shown to be required for in vivo metastatic growth of tumors driven by the KRAS G12V mutation[54] pointing to the depen-dency of these cancers that carry this specific KRAS mutations on the RAL pathway,['RAL']
25557115,However the role of RAL in colorectal cancer with respect to different KRAS muta-tions is unclear[66],['RAL']
25557115,Higher RAL GTPase activation was also observed in bladder cancer cell lines carrying the G12V HRAS mutation compared with cell lines that either are wild-type for RAS or carry other RAS mutations[56],['RAL']
25557115,Bladder cancers have a low to medium RAS mutation frequency but 60% of the total RAS either KRAS or HRAS mutations present are G12V mutations pointing to a potential dependence on the RAL signaling pathway in the majority of RAS-mutant tumors[13],['RAL']
25557115,Based on the currently available information in NSCLC the dependency of pancreatic colorectal and bladder tumors car-rying specific RAS mutations on RAL or other downstream pathways requires investigation,['RAL']
25557115,Drugs against the PI3K AKT and RAF-MEK-ERK pathways are used for the treatment of patients carrying RAS mutations,"['AKT', 'PI3K']"
25557115,RAL GTPase has not been explored as a treatment target for cancer patients harboring RAS mutations,['RAL']
25557115,The only reason for this is the lack of RAL GTPase inhibitors,['RAL']
25557115,These recent findings denote that RAL GTPase is a potential drug target for the treatment of cancer patients carrying specific RAS mutations,['RAL']
25557115,For example we expect that NSCLC patients carrying KRAS G12C or G12V mutations would respond to treatment with a RAL inhibitor whereas patients carrying KRAS G12D mutations should be treated with a PI3K inhibitor,"['RAL', 'PI3K']"
25557115,We expect that targeted therapy against RAL GTPase will be vital in the treatment of cancer patients because KRAS G12C and G12V mutations are abundant in NSCLC as well as colorectal and pancreatic cancers,['RAL']

27994551,Studies have indicated thatthe Akt signaling pathway could be activated by receptortyrosine kinases RTKs  including insulin-like growth factor 1receptor IGF-1R  epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and others Manning and Cantley 2007,['AKT']
27994551,Upon stimulationby RTKs phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K is recruitedto the plasma membrane which subsequently catalyzes thephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4 5-bisphosphate PIP2 to generate phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5-triphosphate PIP3,['PI3K']
27994551,Then the accumulation of PIP3 activates Akt by phosphorylationmodiﬁcation at two regulatory sites Thr308 and Ser473 Cantley,['AKT']
27994551,In addition to RTKs Akt activity can be modulatedby lipid and protein phosphatases such as phosphatase andtensin homolog PTEN and protein phosphatase 2A PP2A,"['AKT', 'PTEN']"

28208579,p53 was identiﬁed in 1979and functioned as the tumor-suppressor gene although it was initially considered as the oncogenefor the ﬁrst ten years [63–66],['P53']
28208579,Wild-type p53 not only limits its transforming ability but also inhibitstransformation mediated by the classic oncogenic protein KRAS [62],['P53']

28208579,Loss of function LOF with wild-type p53and gain of function GOF with mutant p53 may also aid in tumorigenesis,['P53']
28208579,Abolishing mutant p53’soncogenic properties or conversion of mutant p53 to the wild-type form is a potential therapeuticapproach [71 75],['P53']
28208579,Different mutant p53 alleles can localize to the nucleus and or cytoplasm which are unable orable to inhibit autophagy depending on cell context and environment,['P53']
28208579,In addition some p53 mutations including L22Q and W23S retain its pro-apoptotic properties whereas other mutations includingL194F and R280K lose this which may augment tumorigenesis and disease progression [51 56],['P53']
28208579,Similarly mutant such as R172H and R270H and p53 deletions when combined with mutantKRAS inhibit apoptosis and promote tumor metastasis in genetic lung cancer mouse models andpatients [76 77],['P53']

28348561,Therefore EGFR as well as its downstream mediators have been identified as important therapeutic targets,['EGFR']
28348561,The approved small-tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs of EGFR gefitinib Iressa™  erlotinib Tarceva™  and afatinib tykerb™  are effective in a group of NSCLC patients whose tumors carry stimulating muta-tions within the kinase domain of EGFR 16–19,['EGFR']
28348561,EGFR–TKIs are the best option as front-line therapy in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients,['EGFR']
28348561,In pretreated NSCLC EGFR–TKIs are more effective than conventional cytotoxic therapy in existence of EGFR muta-tions 16–19,['EGFR']
28348561,EGFR has seven known ligands among which EGF is one of the most critical 20 21,"['EGFR', 'EGF']"
28348561,The strategy of “sequestering” EGF reproduces the “hormonal castration” therapy known to be effective in hormone-dependent tumors such as breast and prostate thus extending this concept to other types of malignant tumors,['EGF']
28348561,The mechanism of action of CIMAvax-EGF consists on the formation of antibodies against EGF breaking the tolerance to a self-protein,['EGF']
28348561,This is possible because the vaccine consists on a chemical conjugate of the recombinant EGF with the P64k protein derived from the Neisseria meningitidis conjugate EGF-P64K Figure 1 and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 51 22,['EGF']
28348561,CIMAvax-EGF vaccine exerts its anti-cancer activity by targeting the immune system inducing anti-EGF antibodies that result in the decline of the circulating EGF in sera 23 24,['EGF']

28348561,Sera from vaccinated patients inhibited the binding between EGF and its receptor,['EGF']
28348561,Furthermore post-immune sera abrogated EGFR phosphoryla-tion,['EGFR']
28348561,To discern the immune dominance of the antibody response induced by vaccination several peptides mimicking the main EGF epitopes were synthesized,['EGF']

28348561,Long-lasting vaccination resulted in a reduction of serum EGF level,['EGF']
28348561,EGF concentration decreased to undetectable values in all continued vaccinated patients 29,['EGF']
28348561,In summary prolonged vaccination with CIMAvax-EGF induced high anti-EGF antibodies capable to maintain serum EGF in undetectable levels,['EGF']

28348561,Five-year survival rate for patients with high EGF was 23% for vaccinated patients while no controls were alive at the referred time interval,['EGF']
28348561,The association between EGF levels and prognosis remained significant when the prognostic variables gender smoking history performance status and staging were included in the multivariate analysis 26,['EGF']
28348561,Anti-EGF antibodies induced by CIMAvax-EGF inhibit EGF–epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR binding and abrogate EGFR activation,['EGFR']

28348561,In summary the Phase III trial demonstrated that the EGF level in patients’ sera could be simultaneously a biomarker of poor prognosis and a predictive factor of CIMAvax-EGF benefit,['EGF']
28348561,This result confirms the role of the EGF in the biology of the tumor but also provides a biomarker for selecting patients who benefit largely from vaccination with CIMAvax-EGF 26,['EGF']

28657426,Likewise NSCLC Ect2 KD cells form signiﬁcantlysmaller tumors in vivo without an accumulation of mul-tinucleated cells,['ECT2']
28657426,14 Furthermore Cre-induced geneticablation of Ect2 caused an accumulation of multinucle-ated cells in non-transformed primary lung epithelialcells whereas Cre-mediated ablation of Ect2 in Kras Trp53 transformed primary lung epithelial cells didnot,['ECT2']
28657426,10 Thus whereas Ect2 plays a critical role in cytoki-nesis in non-transformed cells the role of Ect2 in cancercell transformation is distinct from its role in cytokinesis,['ECT2']
28657426,Cytoplasmic mislocalization of Ect2 intransformation,['ECT2']
28657426,The cellular localization of Ect2 is cell cycle dependent,['ECT2']
28657426,Ect2 is localized predominantly in the nucleus duringinterphase due to two functional NLS sequences foundwithin its central hinge region,['ECT2']
28657426,1 At the onset of mitosis Ect2 is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm where itassociates with the mitotic spindle at metaphase thecleavage furrow during telophase and the mid-body dur-ing cytokinesis,['ECT2']
28657426,1 The original oncogenic Ect2 clone iso-lated from the keratinocyte cDNA expression libraryconsisted of a carboxyl-terminal truncation of the full-length ECT2 gene,['ECT2']
28657426,2 This truncated clone encoded a pro-tein consisting of the DH-PH-C domains of Ect2 thatlacked the N-terminal sequences thought to regulateEct2 activity and nuclear localization,['ECT2']
28657426,22 As a result thismutant Ect2 localized to the cytoplasm possessed consti-tutive GEF activity and could transform ﬁbroblastcells,['ECT2']
28657426,23 Likewise missense mutations that disrupt NLSfunction cause both cytoplasmic mis-localization andactivation of full-length Ect2 transforming activity,['ECT2']
28657426,Furthermore in some cancer cells a pool of Ect2 isfound to be mis-localized to the cytoplasm during inter-phase,['ECT2']
28657426,14 24 These data suggest that cytoplasmic mis-local-ization plays a key role in Ect2 oncogenic function,['ECT2']
28657426,14 PKCi phosphorylates Ect2 atT328 to activate a Rac1-Pak-Mek-Erk signaling axis thatpromotes NSCLC transformed growth invasion and in,['ECT2']
28657426,14 25 Thus cytoplasmic Ect2 plays acritical role in cellular transformation,['ECT2']
28657426,Ect2 regulates rRNA synthesis in KRAS-driven LADC,['ECT2']
28657426,Cytoplasmic and nuclear Ect2 signaling in NSCLC,['ECT2']
28657426,Cyto- plasmic Ect2 binds to the PKCi-Par6a complex and activates a Rac1 Pak Mek Erk signaling axis that drives transformation in NSCLC cells,"['ECT2', 'RAC1']"
28657426,14 25 Nuclear Ect2 activates rRNA synthesis by binding the nucleolar transcription factor upstream binding factor 1 UBF1 on rDNA promoters and recruiting Rac1 and its down- stream effector nucleophosmin NPM to rDNA,"['ECT2', 'RAC1']"
28657426,predominantly nuclear Ect2 exists in an inactive auto-inhibited state sequestered away from cytoplasmicRho GTPases before nuclear membrane breakdownduring mitosis,['ECT2']
28657426,1 However we and others recently dem-onstrated that nuclear-localized Ect2 is active andcapable of nucleotide exchange,['ECT2']
28657426,6 10 Furthermore wedemonstrated that the transformed growth of LADCcells in vitro and the tumorigenicity of LADC tumorinitiating cells in vivo require nuclear Ect2 GEF activ-ity-mediated upregulation of rDNA transcription,['ECT2']
28657426,Mechanistically we showed that Ect2 binds UBF1 onthe promoter regions of the rDNA to regulate rRNAsynthesis Fig,['ECT2']
28657426,10 We further showed that Rac1 andthe nucleolar protein Nucleophosmin NPM  are crit-ical effectors of Ect2-mediated rRNA synthesis,['RAC1']
28657426,Ect2-mediated activation of Rac1 controls the association ofRac1 with NPM to drive rDNA transcription and thetransformed phenotype,['RAC1']
28657426,10 These data are paradigm-shifting from a view whereby the nuclear pool of Ect2is catalytically inactive to one in which the nuclearpool of Ect2 actively participates in cellular transfor-mation by driving ribosome biogenesis,['ECT2']
28657426,We have identiﬁed a novel Ect2-Rac1-NPM signalingaxis by which Ect2 exerts its oncogenic activity throughregulation of rRNA synthesis in Kras p53 LADC,['ECT2']
28657426,10 How-ever Ect2 is also required for the transformed phenotypeof LSCC cells,['ECT2']
28657426,This association was signiﬁ-cantly stronger for Ect2 than for 15 other known RhoGEFs Fig,['ECT2']
28657426,QPCR analysis of archivedhuman primary LSCC cases and normal lung tissue n D42 revealed that both Ect2 mRNA abundance and 45SrRNA expression were signiﬁcantly higher in tumors mean 5,['ECT2']

28657426,These data suggest a role for Ect2 in ribo-some biogenesis in LSCC tumors,['ECT2']
28657426,To directly test thishypothesis we assessed the effect of Ect2 loss on 45SrRNA levels in LSCC cells,['ECT2']

28805682,Thus several molecular therapies targeting the ALK rearrangementhave been developed or are being developed and are often effective but obtain variable results forsurvival [2 3],['ALK']
28805682,There is now a next generation of ALK inhibitors including twothat have been approved-ceritinib and alectinib-and others that are in development such as brigatiniband lorlatinib [3 6–10],['ALK']
28805682,Moreover ceritinib and the other next-generation ALK inhibitors are morepotent than crizotinib and can overcome tumor cell resistance mechanisms [5],['ALK']
28805682,Taken altogether theseresults highlight the need to perform rapid and highly sensitive screening for an ALK rearrangementin NSCLC patients so that new drugs can be appropriately administered,['ALK']
28805682,An ALK rearrangement is detected in 3 to 7% of patients with stage IIIB IV NSCLC dependingon the series and also probably according to the selection of the patients for molecular testing; in mostcases it concerns an adenocarcinoma [11–15],['ALK']
28805682,The major cause of this change results from the emergence of mutations inthe ALK gene though other mechanisms are possible [18–20],['ALK']
28805682,In view of the therapeutic consequences of the detection of an ALK rearrangement severalmethodological approaches using tissue or cell samples have progressively been developed,['ALK']
28805682,Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH was the ﬁrst to be described,['FISH']
28805682,The emergence of ALK mutations during treatment also raises thequestion of access to new tissue and or cell samples for its detection in particular by methods inmolecular biology,['ALK']
28805682,After brieﬂy covering the biology of lung cancers associated with an ALK rearrangement theconsequences of this rearrangement in cells the epidemiology of lung cancer this review will examinethe different analytical methods that detect this genomic alteration as well as their advantages andlimits and will present algorithms for diagnosis in daily practice,['ALK']
28805682,The ALK Rearrangement in Lung Cancer: Mechanism and Consequences,['ALK']
28805682,The ALK rearrangement leads to constitutive expression of an oncogenic fusion protein initiallydetected in NSCLC [21–23],['ALK']
28805682,At the cellular level ALK regulates canonical signaling pathways thatare shared with other receptor tyrosine kinases including RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways,['ALK']
28805682,When there are some ALK rearrangements 5′ end partners such as EML4 and NPM are fused to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of ALK,['ALK']
28805682,The consequence is aberrant expression of the ALK fusion protein in the cytoplasm,['ALK']
28805682,The differentdomains in the partner proteins promote dimerization and oligomerization of the fusion proteins inducing constitutive activation of the ALK kinase and its downstream signaling pathways [21–23],['ALK']
28805682,More than twenty ALK fusionpartners have been described [24],['ALK']
28805682,The breakpoints on the ALK gene almost always occur in intron19 and rarely in exon 20 resulting in a constant inclusion of the ALK kinase domain in the fusiongene,['ALK']
28805682,Moreover EML4-ALK the most common ALK fusionfound in NSCLC is formed by an inversion occurring on the short arm of chromosome 2 involving thegenes encoding ALK 2p23 and EML4 2p21 with variants 1 2 and 3a 3b being the most frequentfusion patterns [25 26],['ALK']
28805682,In ALK translocated NSCLC EML4does not appear to be the exclusive fusion partner with ALK,['ALK']
28805682,Both were identiﬁed as an ALK-fusion partner from NSCLC tumor samplesand the two proteins also fuse with the intracellular domain of ALK [27 28],['ALK']
28805682,It is noteworthy that thepresence of these non-EML4 fusion partners for ALK can have implications for the method used fordetection of ALK translocated NSCLC in daily practice,['ALK']
28805682,Because the gene rearrangement involvesa large chromosomal inversion and translocation FISH was the ﬁrst method used for detection ofALK rearrangement,['FISH']
28805682,Mutations in the ALK gene result in decreased binding of an inhibitor such ascrizotinib or increased ATP binding afﬁnity [29],['ALK']
28805682,Moreover other resistance mechanisms have beenidentiﬁed such as the activation of EGFR and KRAS pathways by their respective mutations ALK andKIT gene ampliﬁcation and more recently YES1 mutations [29 30],['ALK']
28805682,Epidemiology of Lung Cancers with an ALK Rearrangement,['ALK']
28805682,The percentage of patients with an ALK rearrangement varies from 1% to 5% depending on thepopulation and if all the histological types of NSCLC are taken into consideration or not for evaluationof the presence of an ALK rearrangement while disregarding the smoking status [11 31–34],['ALK']
28805682,So thefrequency of an ALK rearrangement can be higher than 17% for non-smoker and young patients [11 37],['ALK']
28805682,ALK rearrangement is more frequent in acinusforms of adenocarcinomas of Asian patients and in signet-ring cell adenocarcinomas of Caucasianpatients [28 37],['ALK']
28805682,The fact that an ALK rearrangement can exist in certain patients with anepidermoid carcinoma raises the question of systematically analyzing for this modiﬁcation in thishistological type [43],['ALK']
28805682,The presence of an ALK rearrangement almost always excludes the presence ofother genomic alterations associated in particular with mutations in KRAS and EGFR [44],['ALK']
28805682,It is noteworthy thatsome studies reported ALK translocation in non-tumor tissue but below the accepted thresholds fordetermined the ALK status positivity [45],['ALK']
28805682,Methods for Detection of an ALK Rearrangement,['ALK']
28805682,Different methods can be used to deﬁne the ALK status in tumor tissues,['ALK']
28805682,The most frequentlyemployed methods include immunohistochemistry IHC and immunocytochemistry ICC  FISH real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR and NGS,['FISH']
28805682,The FISH reasons for this are numerous,['FISH']
28805682,Thus bad ﬁxation delay in ﬁxation hyperor hypoﬁxation inappropriate ﬁxative solution can have a substantial and variable impact on thedetection level of the expression of the ALK protein and or the quality of the ALK RNA,['ALK']
28805682,It is possible torapidly evaluating the ALK status with IHC on formalin ﬁxed tissue sections which is an easy approachthat does not require a lot of technical or medical expertise,['ALK']
28805682,Several antibodies for the detection ofthe expression of ALK in tissues have been commercialized in particular the 54A Novocastra LeicaBiosystems Buffalo Grove IL USA and D5F3 Cell Signaling Technology Danvers MA USA clones which are the most used and reliable [51–54],['ALK']
28805682,Overall the D5F3 clone seems to give the most satisfactory resultsand is now approved by the FDA as a companion diagnostic test for ALK inhibitors treatment,['ALK']
28805682,Thus patients with a positive ALK IHC can be treated with any speciﬁc ALK inhibitor,['ALK']
28805682,Aside from those described above it isaccepted that even after a too long ﬁxation time the stability of the protein allows detection of mostcases harboring an ALK rearrangement,['ALK']
28805682,A delay inﬁxation also has an impact on the interpretation of ALK IHC when performed on tissue microarrayswith cores removed at random from the center of a tumor that has had a delay in ﬁxation with formalin,['ALK']
28805682,The FISH Method,['FISH']
28805682,FISH was the ﬁrst method used to detect an ALK rearrangement foremost in tissue biopsiesand then on cytological material,"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,FISH was the most frequently used methoduntil the commercialization of anti-ALK antibodies and most laboratories continue to use this approach either as a ﬁrst-line test or to validate a positive IHC or ICC result [62 63],['FISH']
28805682,Additionally rare false negative and false positive results can occur with FISHfor detection of ALK rearrangements,['ALK']
28805682,In the event of an ambiguous FISH analysis some complementary probes can beused [67],['FISH']
28805682,An approach using RT-PCR for detection of an ALK rearrangement in tissue and cell samples hasbeen proposed [68 69],['ALK']
28805682,A multiplex RT-PCR-basedassay can detect with sensitivity certain ALK fusion gene variants although reproducible RT-PCRresults are difﬁcult to obtain with FFPE tissue sections [70 71],['ALK']
28805682,One advantage of RT-PCR in contrast to IHC and FISH isthat this technique is free from subjectivity in assessment of the analysis,['FISH']
28805682,Moreover identiﬁcation ofthe speciﬁc variant can be determined using RT-PCR which could be important in predicting patientresponse to ALK inhibitors,['ALK']
28805682,In this context any PCR based strategy must incorporate validated primer pairs forall known ALK fusions to avoid false negative results,['ALK']
28805682,Moreover more than 20 putative fusion partnersof ALK have been described so fare,['ALK']
28805682,The detection of an ALK rearrangement can be associated with examination for fusions on the ROS1 andNTRK genes which avoids sequential analyses that are costly time consuming and require additionalbiological material [47 78],['ALK']
28805682,Several recent studies describe the potential of the NGS technique for thedetection of an ALK rearrangement in routine practice but a number of [79 80],['ALK']
28805682,In particular a targeted panel will cover the fusion genes of interest for NSCLC including ALK ROS1 NTRK1 RET will be launched at the end of 2017 [81],['ALK']
28805682,However a numberof pitfalls and or limitations of NGS approach for ALK rearrangement detection need to be pointedout,['ALK']
28805682,In fact we have to thinks that presently it isrecommended that an ALK result be provided for the physicians within 10 days after the performedbiopsy [82],['ALK']
28805682,An additional advantage of NGS is the detection of potential presence of some ALKmutations in particular when considering survival of patients on ALK inhibitors,['ALK']
28805682,These mutations arethe main reason for progression or relapse of patients on speciﬁc ALK inhibitors,['ALK']
28805682,It is of interest tonote that depending on the inhibitor used certain mutation in the ALK gene emerge more frequentlyand resistance to a speciﬁc inhibitor requires a quick change in inhibitor [18],['ALK']
28805682,In particular this approach hasbeen developed for detection of an ALK rearrangement [83],['ALK']
28805682,Moreover a single-tube test for ALK ROS1 and RET fusions has been recentlydeveloped [85],['ALK']
28805682,Globally around 20% tumor cellularity isrequired for detection but the detection of an ALK fusion transcript could be possible in samples withas low as 5% tumor cellularity,['ALK']
28805682,Finally nanoString might provide additional information complementary toIHC and FISH,['FISH']
28805682,In situ hybridization with RNA has also been described for evaluation of the tissueexpression of an ALK rearrangement [86–88],['ALK']
28805682,Finally multiplex IHC analyses are also beingdeveloped to analyze in parallel the ALK status and the expression of certain checkpoint inhibitors and these analyses can participate in studies into novel therapeutic strategies [89],['ALK']
28805682,Taken the number of different approaches available for the evaluation of the ALK status inthe daily practice several comparative studies have evaluated their sensitivity and speciﬁcity,['ALK']
28805682,Several studies have compared IHC in particular using theD5F3 clone and ALK FISH which show very good concordant results with a sensitivity of 81 to100% and a speciﬁcity of 82 to 100% depending on the study [62 90–94],"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,However these resultsmust take into consideration the intensity of the label and only the strong label 3+ concords at100% with the ALK results obtained with FISH [95],"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,These discordant results were ALK-positive with IHCand ALK-negative with FISH,['FISH']
28805682,This can be explained by false negative FISH results from difﬁcult tointerpret samples and a positive result from less than 20% tumor cells [65 99],['FISH']
28805682,FISH does not detectall ALK rearrangements and certain complex rearrangements reduce the distance between the twoFISH probes which can give a false negative FISH image [46],"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,Aside from the difference in sensitivityand speciﬁcity the discord can sometimes be explained by the intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity interms of the ALK status in particular when comparing IHC ICC or FISH and methods using directextraction of RNA without prior visual control of the lesion [49 101 102],"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,Certain isoforms of ALKarise from a mechanism of alternative initiation of transcription giving protein expression that is notALK-positive with FISH [103],['FISH']
28805682,It is important to mention that some patients ALK-positive with IHCand ALK-negative with FISH can respond to treatment with crizotinib [104 105],['FISH']
28805682,A negative IHCresult can be observed in cases of ALK ampliﬁcation [106 107],['ALK']
28805682,In the same way negative FISH resultscan be associated with positive RT-PCR results [108],['FISH']
28805682,Some studies have compared the speciﬁcityand sensitivity of IHC FISH RT-PCR and or NGS [109–111],['FISH']
28805682,Finally other studies have shown verygood concordance of the results obtained with the nanoString testing with IHC and FISH while somediscrepancy was observed in other studies [112–114],['FISH']
28805682,In conclusion although correlation between the results for ALK IHC and ALK FISH is excellent as a predictive marker for response to ALK inhibitor therapy IHC alone has recently been validatedwith the D5F3 IHC assay [115],"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,Comparison of different methods for ALK testing in tissue sample,['ALK']
28805682,Algorithms for Diagnosis of an ALK Rearrangement,['ALK']
28805682,The substantial number of technological approaches for detection of an ALK rearrangement raisesthe question of their complementarity or lack of complementarity and the necessity to see developmentof different approaches in the same laboratory so as to reply to the needs of physicians [116 117],['ALK']
28805682,At present the extensively employed algorithm consists in ﬁrst-line ALKIHC or ICC and if the result is positive FISH analysis is used for conﬁrmation,['FISH']
28805682,A negative IHC doesnot lead to other analyses and the ALK status is considered to be negative,['ALK']
28805682,A second algorithm withﬁrst-line ALK IHC ICC and then if positive NGS analysis can be proposed for conﬁrmation [109 110],['ALK']
28805682,Therefore it is noteworthy to mentionthat so far in USA the ALK D5F3 CDx IHC assay and the FISH ALK break apart assay are the onlyassays that have obtained regulatory approval,"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,In this context if other assays such as those basedon RT-PCR NGS and the Nanostring approach should be used as CDx for ALK inhibitor treatments it will be mandatory to do extensive analytical and clinical validation studies as well as some ringstudies with external quality assessment,['ALK']
28805682,As an example for FISH analysis the FDA recommended counting at least 50 tumorcells for ALK status assessment and if 15–25 cells demonstrated an ALK rearrangement an additional50 tumor cells have to be counted by another pathologist,"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,Current algorithm proposed at the LPCE Nice Hospital France for ALK testing [incorporating into the standard of care ROS1 status and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor gene EGFR mutation testing in lung adenocarcinoma],['ALK']
28805682,To provide patients with advanced-stage NSCLC with ALK inhibitors it is essential to systematically analyze for ALK rearrangements using a rapid cost effective and reliable approach [1 3],['ALK']
28805682,For a long time the FISH technique was the only method for evaluation of the ALK status,"['FISH', 'ALK']"
28805682,However FISH analysis is now considered to be labor-intensive quite expensive and difficult to implement systematically in all pathology laboratories as a screening and diagnostic assay,['FISH']
28805682,Moreover the discordant results comparing IHC and FISH are problematic and are quite frequent in cases with borderline FISH positivity 15–20% split nuclei,['FISH']

29415985,●In addition to developing pharmacological inhibitorsof USP28 what are other efﬁcient strategies oftargeting USP28 that have clinical adaptability andfeasibility for treating cancers?,['USP28']
29415985,For example agonists of FBW7 can promote degradation of c-MYCand cyclin E in the tumor cells2,['FBW7']
29415985,In this review we focuson discussing the speciﬁc roles of USP28 in cancerpathways and their potential therapeutic values in cancertreatment,['USP28']
29415985,The roles of USP28 in cancer-related pathways,['USP28']
29415985,USP28 was initially identiﬁed through homology searchfor USP25,['USP28']
29415985,Like USP25 the USP28 gene contains alter-natively spliced exons which can produce tissue-speciﬁcisoforms of the enzymes9,['USP28']
29415985,USP28 is highly homologous toUSP25 bothofwhichcontainubiquitin-associateddomain and ubiquitin-interactingmotifs inthe N-terminal region5,['USP28']
29415985,The emerging roles of USP28 in can-cer pathways have been revealed by some recent studies,['USP28']
29415985,Below we will review the mechanisms accounting for theinvolvement of USP28 in these pathways Fig 3 Table 1  hence demonstrating its signiﬁcance as a therapeutictarget for cancer treatment,['USP28']
29415985,USP28 can counteract the activity ofFBW7 and promote c-MYC stability in cancer cells,['USP28']
29415985,Overexpression of USP28 inhibited FBW7-depedent ubi-quitination of c-MYC and cyclin E1 both of which areoncoproteins,['USP28']
29415985,Depletion of USP28 in some cancer celllines phenocopies the effect of MYC depletion,['USP28']
29415985,As aresult USP28 is required for c-MYC-mediated tumor cellproliferation,['USP28']
29415985,FBW7 is an F-box protein and an importantcomponent of the SKP1-CUL1-F-BOX SCF -type E3ubiquitin ligase and determines the substrate speciﬁcityof the SCF complex,['FBW7']
29415985,FBW7 is considered as a tumorsuppressor that controls cell proliferation differentiation and apoptosis by targeting key transcriptional factors toubiquitin-directed proteasome degradation17,['FBW7']
29415985,In addition to stabilizing the FBW7-substrates USP28was also found to directly stabilize FBW7 itself whichleads to reduction of FBW7 substrate proteins,['FBW7']
29415985,This raises an interesting questionregarding the dual functions of USP28: whether it isoncogenic or tumor-suppressive? An accountable expla-nation is that the levels of USP28 vary considerably indifferent cells which can inﬂuence the stability and reg-ulation of FBW7 in these cells,"['USP28', 'FBW7']"
29415985,As a result the dual reg-ulation of USP28 on FBW7 may serve as a mechanism tomaintain the physiological levels of proto-oncogenicFBW7 substrates,"['USP28', 'FBW7']"
29415985,In this model USP28 may serve aseither a tumor promotor or suppressor depending on thestatus of autocatalytic ubiquitination of FBW7,"['USP28', 'FBW7']"
29415985,In theintestine USP28 deletion does not affect FBW7 stabilityand attenuates tumorigenesis while in tissues whereFBW7 autocatalytic turnover is favored deletion ofUSP28 resembles FBW7 loss-of-function thus exhibitinga tumor-promoting effect20,"['USP28', 'FBW7']"
29415985,It is also worth noting that inaddition to the aforementioned oncogenic proteins othersubstrates that are known not be associated with FBW7 are also subject to deubiquitination and stabilization byUSP28 including Claspin CHK2 and LSD121–23,"['CHK2', 'FBW7']"
29415985,Thisfact adds another layer of complexity regarding the rolesof USP28 in cancer-related pathways,['USP28']
29415985,In addition to affecting the turnover of critical onco-proteins like MYC USP28 may regulate other essentialpathways in cancer progression,['USP28']
29415985,A study has proposed anovel mechanism by which USP28 upregulates angio-genesis by antagonizing GSK-3β glycogen synthasekinase-3β and FBW7-dependent degradation of HIF-1α hypoxia-induciblefactor-1α  amajorregulatorofangiogenesis carcinogenesis and various processes bywhich cells adapt to hypoxic conditions,['USP28']
29415985,HIF-1α isdegraded after phosphorylation by GSK-3β and recruit-ment of FBW7 a process that can be reversed by over-expressing USP28,"['USP28', 'FBW7']"
29415985,Importantly stabilization of HIF-1α byUSP28 is dependent on FBW7 and as a result FBW7 andUSP28 reciprocally regulate angiogenesis and metastasisin an HIF-1α-dependent manner24,['FBW7']
29415985,Therefore modula-tion of HIF-1 functions by GSK-3 FBW7 USP28 maycontribute to a novel adaptive mechanism for the cell torespond to various signals that affect cell proliferation differentiation and apoptosis,"['USP28', 'FBW7']"
29415985,alternative way to regulate HIF-1–dependent cancerpathways by targeting USP28,['USP28']
29415985,An early study has shown USP28 plays animportant role in the control of the DDR22,['USP28']
29415985,3-kinase-like kinases PIKKs  such as ATM and ATR transduced by various cellular factors before activatingtheir downstream checkpoint kinases like CHK1 andCHK2,"['ATM', 'CHK1', 'ATR']"
29415985,USP28 was initially identiﬁed as a 53BP1-binding partner in a tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation experi-ment,['USP28']
29415985,Mechanistically USP28 deubiquitinates and stabi-lizes the speciﬁcity factors and mediators of ATM andATR signaling by protecting them from ubiquitination-mediated proteasome degradation,"['ATM', 'USP28']"
29415985,The catalytic domain of USP28 is required for thisregulation as well and a dominant-negative mutant of a,['USP28']
29415985,3 The mechanisms by which USP28 is involved in the cancer-related pathways,['USP28']
29415985,Upper panel USP28 counteracts the activity of E3 ligases,['USP28']
29415985,USP28 antagonizes FBW7 an F-box protein and an important component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-BOX SCF -type E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets key transcriptional factors to ubiquitin-directed proteasome degradation,"['USP28', 'FBW7']"
29415985,USP28 also upregulates angiogenesis by antagonizing GSK-3β glycogen synthase kinase-3β and FBW7-dependent degradation of HIF-1α hypoxia-inducible factor-1α  a major regulator of angiogenesis carcinogenesis and various processes by which the cell adapts to hypoxic conditions,['USP28']
29415985,Middle panel USP28 modulates key factors in DNA damage response wherein it forms a complex with PIRH2 and CHK2 and antagonizes PIRH2-mediated poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CHK2,"['USP28', 'PIRH2', 'CHK2']"
29415985,USP28 can stabilize Claspin and maintain the G2 arrest thus promoting the ATR-mediated activation of Chk1,"['CHK1', 'USP28']"
29415985,catalytic cysteine phenocopies USP28 knockdown cells,['USP28']
29415985,Therefore USP28 may restrain ubiquitination-mediatedproteolysis of the components in DDR,['USP28']
29415985,Interestingly inanother study CHK2 is shown to be directly regulated byUSP28,['CHK2']
29415985,The ubiquitin E3 ligase PIRH2 p53-inducedprotein with a RING-H2 domain interacts with CHK2and mediates its ubiquitination-directed proteasomaldegradation,['PIRH2']
29415985,USP28 forms a complex with PIRH2 andCHK2 and counteracts the negative regulation of PIRH2on CHK221,"['USP28', 'PIRH2']"
29415985,Although in this system the phenotype ofUSP28-deﬁcient cells is unclear CHK2 is expected to bedestabilized by knockdown of USP28 which may lead tothe negative regulation of DDR,"['USP28', 'CHK2']"
29415985,However it is worthnoting that regulation of DDR by USP28 has another layerof complexity—USP28 is involved in multiple pathwaysthat can have opposing functions,['USP28']
29415985,Therefore the effect of USP28 on survival duringDDR is determined by the net balance of these opposingpathways in the cell under the physiological milieus andcan be tissue—and cell type-dependent,['USP28']
29415985,USP28 has been shown to main-tain the G2 arrest by stabilizing Claspin a key regulator ofCHK130,['USP28']
29415985,Additionally inthis system USP28 only targets Claspin but not PLK1 both of which are subject to ubiquitination by the sameE3 ligase,['USP28']

29415985,Targeting USP28 in non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC,['USP28']
29415985,USP28 has been suggested as a therapeutic target forNSCLC,['USP28']
29415985,In one study USP28 was found to be upregulatedin the NSCLC tumors,['USP28']
29415985,Importantly poor survivals werecorrelated with high levels of USP28 in patients,['USP28']
29415985,Thecancer-promoting role of USP28 was conﬁrmed by in vitroassays where overexpressing USP28 could enhance NSCLCcell proliferation while downregulating it induced apoptosis,['USP28']
29415985,Interestingly USP28 may be targeted by a microRNA miR-4295 as USP28 3′UTR-driven luciferase activity was sig-niﬁcantly reduced by miR-429555,['USP28']
29415985,In a different study however miR-3940-5p was identi-ﬁed to target USP28 and CCND1 Cyclin D1 in NSCLC,['USP28']
29415985,Therefore miR-3940-5p may target CCND1 and USP28 to inhibit NSCLCgrowth,['USP28']
29415985,Indeed downregulation of miR-3940-5p wasconcomitant with upregulation of CCND1 and USP28 inNSCLC tissues and cell lines,['USP28']
29415985,It was veriﬁed that CCND1 and USP28 weredirect targets of miR-3940-5p and the phenotypes ofNSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis imposed by miR-3940-5pcouldbeattenuatedbyoverexpressionofCCND1 or USP28,['USP28']
29415985,targeting USP28 was further demonstrated by in vivoexperiments where overexpressing miR-3940-5p inhibitedthe growth of NSCLC tumors,['USP28']
29415985,Therefore USP28 andCCND1 may be promising diagnostic markers and ther-apeutic targets for NSCLC56,['USP28']
29415985,Targeting USP28 in breast cancer,['USP28']
29415985,One study has revealed a critical mechanism underlyingthe epigenetic regulation by USP28 in breast cancer,['USP28']
29415985,Anunbiased siRNA screening against all the human DUBsyielded USP28 as a bona ﬁde deubiquitinase of LSD1 lysine-speciﬁc demethylase 1,['USP28']

29415985,Disrupting USP28 leads to LSD1 desta-bilization whichsuppressescancerstemcell-likecharacteristics in vitro and inhibits tumorigenicity in vivo,['USP28']
29415985,Therefore targeting USP28 provides another treatmentapproach against breast cancer23,['USP28']

29415985,The knowledge of the role of USP28 in bladder cancer is verylimited,['USP28']
29415985,Targeting USP28 in gliomasThe signiﬁcance of USP28 in glioma tumorigenesis hasbeen demonstrated by its positive regulation on MYC which is dysregulated in the majority of gliomas and dif-ﬁcult to target directly,['USP28']
29415985,It was determined that USP28 wasupregulated in human gliomas but not in normal braintissues,['USP28']
29415985,The USP28 protein level in human glioma tissueswas directly correlated with glioma grade and wasinversely correlated with patient survivals,['USP28']
29415985,Importantly USP28 promoted MYC expression whichwas required for USP28-induced cell growth in humanglioma,['USP28']

29973561,Unfortunately the development of TKI resistance is common after prolonged use of these EGFR TKIs [9],['EGFR']
29973561,One major mechanism for the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is the development of the T790M secondary mutation within the EGFR kinase domain,['EGFR']
29973561,The bulkier methionine residue at position 790 sterically hinders its interaction with TKIs and increases affinity for ATP thus reducing inhibitor binding to the EGFR kinase domain while preserving catalytic activity [10],['EGFR']

29973561,In fact MET gene ampliﬁcation is shown to beone of the most relevant mechanisms responsible for the acquired resistance against EGFR TKIs Figure 2 [70],['EGFR']

29973561,A recent Phase III FLAURA trial demonstrated thesuperiority of osimertinib over ﬁrst-generation EGFR inhibitors geﬁtinib and erlotinib as a ﬁrst-linetreatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC,['EGFR']
29973561,Although mutant EGFR NSCLC patients bearing exon 20 insertions are generallyunresponsive to ﬁrst-line TKI therapy recent studies suggest that osimertinib may prove effective asa therapy for patients with these activating mutations,['EGFR']
29973561,However resistance to this TKI has alreadybeen reported arising via mutations in the C797 EGFR codon and EGFR G796D as well as ampliﬁedHER2 and MET signaling [18–20],['EGFR']
29973561,Another study demonstrated high levels of MET ampliﬁcation seen intumor biopsies of a mutant T790M EGFR NSCLC patient following osimertinib treatment,['EGFR']
29973561,Another third generation TKI rociletinib was designed toinhibit the activating EGFR mutation and the T790M resistance mutation with a focus on sparingwild-type EGFR,['EGFR']
29973561,This design was shown to be effective in preclinical models in which rociletinibwas found to have signiﬁcantly less activity against wild-type EGFR than the early-generation TKIscurrently being used clinically as well as AZD9291 [21],['EGFR']
29973561,A fourth generation TKI EAI045 has been developed as a novel EGFR inhibitor to overcome bothC797 and T790M mutations that confer resistance to third generation inhibitors,['EGFR']
29973561,other EGFR TKIs acts via allosteric inhibition rather than competitive inhibition of the ATP-bindingsite,['EGFR']
29973561,The growth inhibitory activity of EAI045 increases when combined with cetuximab an EGFRinhibitor that prevents EGFR from dimerizing,['EGFR']
29973561,Additionally since dimerization-defective independent mutants were markedly more sensitive to EAI045 it ishypothesized that EAI045 acts upon a single component of the EGFR dimer [20 23],['EGFR']
29973561,Thus EAI045treatment appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy in NSCLC patients with resistance to ﬁrst second and third generation EGFR TKIs,['EGFR']
29973561,Patients being treated with EGFR inhibitors will requirecontinual assessment of progression of lung cancer in order to study how these patients becomeresistant to therapy and to develop strategies to prevent resistance,['EGFR']

30060526,Miyoshi and coworkers have analyzed the genome profiling of 78 LCNECs by targeted capture sequencing of all the coding exons of 244 cancer-related genes and observed: frequent inactivating mutations in TP53 71% and RB1 26% ; genetic alterations in PI3K AKT mTOR pathway [15% including RICTOR 5%  PI3KCA 3%  PTEN 4%  AKT2 4% and mTOR 1% ]; activating mutations at the level of RTKs [FGFR1 5%  KIT 4%  ERBB2 4%  EGFR 1% ] and RAS pathways [KRAS 6% and HRAS 1% ],['EGFR']
30060526,RTKs [FGFR1 5%  KIT 4%  ERBB2 4%  EGFR 1% ] and RAS pathways [KRAS 6% and HRAS 1% ],['EGFR']
30060526,The self-renewal of ATII cells is induced in vitro byactivation of the EGFR and in vivo by oncogenic KRasG12D eliciting the formation of multifocal clonaladenomas [137],['EGFR']
30060526,Zheng and coworkers have usedthis methodology of xenotransplantation and have obtained the development of 10 patient-derivedNSCLC xenograft models representative of various genetic abnormalities observed in these tumors such as EGFR mutations KRAS mutations FGFR1 ampliﬁcations and MET ampliﬁcations [212],['EGFR']
30060526,In contrast mice bearing a mutant human EGFR transgene EGFRT790M-L485R develop adenocarcinomas representative of lung adenocarcinomas occurring in non-smoker patients,['EGFR']
30060526,To further stress the notion that alveolar type II cells can be the originating cells forNSCLCs these authors have introduced and expressed mutant EGFR into SPC+ cells and have observedtumor formation in alveoli [227],['EGFR']
30060526,Thus they have explored the three mostcommon mouse lung cancer models: KRasG12D; KRasG12Din mice with conditional p53 deﬁciency inp53ﬂox ﬂox; EGFR mutant,['EGFR']
30060526,Another important model of mouse lung cancerogenesis was based on the expression of clinicallyrelevant EGFR mutants into mouse pneumocytes,['EGFR']
30060526,As mentioned above somatic mutations in exonsencoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene are frequently observed in human lungadenocarcinomas and are associated with sensitivity to some TK inhibitors,['EGFR']
30060526,The large majorityof EGFR mutations or short deletions occur at the level of exon 19,['EGFR']
30060526,To evaluate the oncogenicpotential of EGFR mutations transgenic mice expressing either EGFR∆L747-S752 or EGFRL858R in type IIpneumocytes have been developed [233],['EGFR']
30060526,The same authorshave developed another mouse model using another EGFR mutant [233],['EGFR']
30060526,Both the transgenic mice develop lung tumors thatare resistant to EGFR TK inhibitors [38],['EGFR']
30060526,Interestingly the drug triﬂuoroperazinehydrochloride which inhibits the FOXO1 nuclear export restored sensitivity of EGFR TK resistant lungcancer cells in vitro and in vivo [234],['EGFR']
30060526,These observations suggest that the KLF6 FOXO1 transcriptionalnetwork may represent an important EGFR oncogenic signaling pathway that can be targeted for thetreatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma,['EGFR']
30060526,Interestingly a recent study compared the genomic abnormalities observed in lungadenocarcinomas driven by mutant KRAS or EGFR and by overexpression of MYC; tumors frommodels driven by strong cancer drivers such as mutant EGFR and KRAS harbored few mutations inknown cancer genes whereas tumors driven by MYC acquired recurrent clonal KRAS mutations,['EGFR']
30060526,In a phase III trial 305 patients who had previously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1expression on at least 50% of tumor cells and no sensitizing mutation of the EGFR or translocationof the ALK gene were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or the investigator’schoice of platinum-based chemotherapy,"['EGFR', 'ALK']"
30060526,Recently a double-blind phase III trial randomly assigned 616 NSCLC patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC without EGFRand ALK mutations who were chemotherapy-naïve to receive pemetrexed and a platinum-baseddrug plus either placebo or pembrolizumab [284],['ALK']
30060526,The conclusion was that pembrolizumabadministration may improve the survival of non-squamous EGFR and ALK-WT NSCLC with untreatedmetastatic disease,['EGFR']
30060526,The objective response rate was 20% and compared favorably with historicalcontrols; the median overall survival was from 15–23 months in three different cohorts of patients;PD-L1 status was a predictive marker in that patients with higher PD-L1 expression tended to havebetter responses; responses to treatment occurred regardless of EGFR or KRAS mutation status [286],['EGFR']
30060526,Garassino andcoworkers recently reported the results of a phase II ATLANTIC study involving the administrationof durvalumab anti-PD-L1 as third-line o later treatment for advanced NSCLC subdivided into threesubgroups: a EGFR ALK-mutants; b non-EGFR ALK mutants with <25% or at least 25% PD-L1expression; c non-EGFR ALK-mutants with at least 90% of tumor cells with PD-L1 expression [287],"['EGFR', 'ALK']"
30060526,The most commonly mutated genes in in lung adenocarcinoma include KRAS and EGFR andthe tumor suppressor genes TP53 KEAP1 STK11 and NF1,['EGFR']
30060526,KRAS and EGFR mutations are usuallymutually exclusive but when they co-exist KRAS mutations confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors,['EGFR']
30060526,Lung adenocarcinomas harboring oncogenic driver mutations at the level of EGFR and ROS1 andALK rearrangements have a lower mutational load often occur in never smokers and are sensitive totargeting with speciﬁc inhibitors and this offered new therapeutic perspectives for these patients,['EGFR']
30060526,KRAS and EGFR mutations are usually present in the founder clones of lung adenocarcinoma while TP53 mutations are frequently acquired during advanced stages of tumor development thussuggesting a role during tumor progression [324],['EGFR']
30060526,The genomic landscape of lung cancers is markedly different between never smokers and smokers with: the non-smokers showing a lower tumor mutational burden a predominant transition of cytosineto thymine C > T and a higher frequency of actionable driving gene alterations such as EGFRmutations and ALK and ROS1 fusions; the smokers exhibiting a clearly higher mutation burden predominantly cytosine to adenine C > A nucleotide transversions and non-actionable mutations such as KRAS and TP53 mutations,['ALK']
30060526,In this context particularly relevant were the studies carried out in lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations andALK rearrangements,['EGFR']
30060526,8% with EGFR mutations and 8,['EGFR']
30060526,the frequency of ALK-rearrangements in NSCLC occurring before40 years was very high 25−50%  while it was markedly lower in patients after 50 years 2−8%  ; ii EGFR mutations were clearly associated with lower tobacco exposure and moderate to highdifferentiation [325] Figure 5,['EGFR']
30060526,The most common mutations include exon 19 deletions and a missense mutation onexon 21 L858R ; these mutations confer sensitivity to EGFR TKIs,['EGFR']
30060526,In order to inhibit the growthof EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas three generations of EGFR TKIs have been developed,['EGFR']
30060526,First-generation EGFR TKIs reversible competitive ATP inhibitors targeting only EGFR such aserlotinib and geﬁtinib have shown higher response rates and improved PFS compared to standardchemotherapy in previously untreated patients with EGFR mutations,['EGFR']
30060526,However patients treatedwith these inhibitors ineluctably relapse most frequently due to a second EGFR mutation in exon20 T790M,['EGFR']
30060526,To bypass these limitations a second generation of EGFR TKIs was developed mainlyrepresented by Afatinib and Dacomitinib acting as irreversible EGFR TKIs targeting also HER2and HER4,['EGFR']
30060526,administration of geﬁtinib was detrimental to NSCLC patients with EGFR-mutant tumors with diseaseprogression; in these patients treatment with the ﬁrst-generation EGFR TKI must be discontinued [328],['EGFR']

30060526,Third generation EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib are selective inhibitors of both the original sensitizing and T790M mutations but spar the normal EGFR,['EGFR']
30060526,Importantly in a randomized trial comparing Osimertinib to first generation EGFR TKIs erlotinib or gefitinib in previously untreated NSCLC patients with EGFR-mutant tumors osimertinib administration was associated with a significant improvement of PFS 17 vs,['EGFR']

30060526,Third generation EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib are selective inhibitors of both the originalsensitizing and T790M mutations but spar the normal EGFR,['EGFR']
30060526,Importantly in a randomized trial comparing Osimertinib to ﬁrst generation EGFR TKIs erlotinib,['EGFR']
30060526,This important study represents the basis for establishing osimertinib asa ﬁrst line EGFR TKI option,['EGFR']
30060526,In this study an attemptwas made to try to understand the mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib in patients with diseaseprogression investigating circulating tumor DNA: 50% of these patients had no-detectable ctDNAand in the remaining patients the molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance were heterogeneous MET ampliﬁcation EGFR and KRAS ampliﬁcation MEK1 KRAS or PI3KC mutations EGFR C797Smutations JAK2 mutations HER2 exon 20 mutation ; importantly there was no evidence of acquiredEGFR T790M mutation in progressing patients treated with osimertinib [331],['EGFR']
30060526,Interestingly the Chinese patients show an increased incidence of NSCLC with EGFR mutationscompared to Caucasian patients [333],['EGFR']
30060526,These tumors are characterized by a mutational MS3 signaturethat is associated with inﬂammatory tumor inﬁltrating B lymphocytes: as a consequence the frequencyof EGFR mutations is very high among lung cancers with a MS3 signature [333],['EGFR']
30060526,According to these observations it was suggested that inﬂammatory inﬁltration maycontribute to the accumulation of EGFR mutations particularly in never-smoker patients,['EGFR']
30060526,The various combinations of EGFR mutants determinea spectrum of sensitivity resistance to the various EGFR TKIs and studies are in progress to deﬁneEGFR TKIs able to inhibit NSCLCs bearing triple mutants sensitizing mutations + T790M + C797S :these new mutants such as EA1045 could represent the fourth-generation of EGFR TKIs [334],['EGFR']
30060526,The history of treatments with ALK-rearranged NSCLCs is very similar to that describedfor EGFR mutant patients with progressive identiﬁcation and introduction in clinical use of ﬁrst second and third-generation ALK inhibitors,"['EGFR', 'ALK']"
30060526,The ﬁrst generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib improvedoverall response rate and PFS compared to cytotoxic therapy in untreated and previously treatedALK-mutant NSCLCs,['ALK']
30060526,Unfortunately all patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC develop drug resistantdisease mostly due to the development selection of new ALK mutations or ALK copy numbergain,['ALK']
30060526,Second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors ceritinib alectinib brigatinib lorlatinib arestructurally different and characterized by a higher afﬁnity for ALK and different selectivity forvarious ALK mutants,['ALK']
30060526,The rationale of treating ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients with ALK inhibitors is supported by dataon the overall survival,['ALK']
30060526,There is evidence about an improvement of overall survivalamong NSCLC patients who experienced progressive disease after crizotinib treatment and whowere treated with next-generation-guided ALK inhibitor [338],['ALK']
30060526,The development of the technology todetect circulating tumor DNA offers the unique opportunity to detect longitudinally during patients’treatment the mutational evolution of ALK and to serve as a guide for deﬁnition of optimal ALKinhibitor therapy [339],['ALK']
30060526,Thus the longitudinal analysis of plasma specimens from ALK-positivepatients with acquired resistance to ALK TKIs allowed to track the evolution of resistance duringtreatment and to deﬁne an optimized treatment [339],['ALK']
30060526,It is important to underline that only half of thetumors that develop resistance to secondary-generation ALK inhibitors harbor resistance mutations inALK while the other half have other mechanisms underlying resistance,['ALK']
30060526,Importantly two recent studies support a real impact of ALK TKIs on the overall survival ofALK-positive NSCLCs,['ALK']
30060526,The longest OS was observed in crizotinib-treated patientswho received a subsequent ALK TKI [341],['ALK']
30060526,The kinase domain of ROS1 displays a great homology withthose of ALK and this explains the inhibitory activity against ROS1-positive tumors of drugs such ascrizotinib ceritinib or lorlatinib active against ALK-mutant tumors,['ALK']
30060526,The main mechanisms of crizotinib resistance is related to the presence of ROS1resistance mutations particularly of the G2031R ROS1 mutation activation of the wild-type EGFR signaling KRAS andKIT mutations,['EGFR']
30060526,Following these guidelines the genes whose alterations have to be tested havebeen grouped into three different categories: a a set of genes that must be offered by all laboratories that test lung cancers including EGFR ALK and ROS1; b a second set of genes that should beincluded in any expanded set of genes including BRAF MET RET ERBB2 and KRAS; c KRAS testingmay be performed also as a single-gene test to exclude patients from expanded panel testing [352 353],"['EGFR', 'ALK']"
30060526,The ﬁrst-line therapeutic recommendations forpatients with lung adenocarcinoma without an EGFR-sensitizing mutation or ALK or ROS1 generearrangement with a good performance status are the following: a with high PD-L1 expression andnon-contraindications single-agent pembrolizumab is recommended; b with low PD-L1 expression a variety of combination cytotoxic chemotherapies platinum doublet with pemetrexed ± bacivuzumabor carboplatin pemetreexed pembrolizumab,['ALK']

30060526,The second-linetherapeutic treatment for lung adenocarcinoma patients without a tumor with EGFR ALK andROS1 alterations implies: a in both patients with high PD-L1 expression who received ﬁrst-linechemotherapy and have not received prior immunotherapy and patients with low or unknown tumorPD-L1 expression who received ﬁrst-line chemotherapy single-agent nivolumab atezolizumab orpembrolizumab is recommended; b in patients who received an immune checkpoint inhibitor asﬁrst-line therapy a variety of cytotoxic chemotherapies are recommended; c in patients who receivedcytotoxic chemotherapy and pembrolizumab as ﬁrst-line treatment docetaxel ± ramicirumab orgemcitabine is recommended,"['EGFR', 'ALK']"

30186041,[25] found knockdown of ZFAS1 affected the expression of the notch signal-related proteins including HES fam-ily bHLH transcription factor 1 HES-1 and notch intra-cellular domain NICD  which indicate ZFAS1 may be another key activator of notch signaling,['ZFAS1']
30186041,However how ZFAS1 activates the notch signaling direct or indirect is unknown until now,['ZFAS1']
30186041,It has been demonstrated that ZFAS1 could regulate the expression of above gene thus promote the tumorgenesis and progression of various cancers such as melanoma glioma colorectal cancer and gastric cancer [26 30 37 47],['ZFAS1']
30186041,It was demonstrated that ZFAS1 exerted as ceRNA to enhance the expression of proliferation invasion and metastasis related genes such as ZEB1 MMP-14 MMP16 BMI1 Sp1 and ZEB2 by competitively sponging miR-150 miR-200b or miR-200c [41 49] which indicated ZFAS1 became a new lncRNA functioning as ceRNA in cancer,['ZFAS1']

30186041,ZFAS1 is upregulated and plays an oncogenic role in most types of tumors,['ZFAS1']

31083461,alsodemonstrated that when RKIP expression was reestablished in metastatic cells their invasion capacitywas inhibited but the growth of the primary tumor was not aﬀected [63],['RKIP']
31083461,It is now known that RKIP is a multifunctional protein in carcinogenesis andthrough the modulation of diﬀerent intracellular signaling pathways it is able to control cellulargrowth [65 66] motility [67 68] epithelial–mesenchymal transition EMT [69] and invasion [70],['RKIP']
31083461,Importantly it was also established that RKIP downregulation leads to a dramatic inhibition ofapoptosis and development of chemoresistance to conventional cytotoxic drugs in tumor cells [62 71],['RKIP']
31083461,Despite the increased importance of RKIP as a metastatic and prognostic marker in human cancer the mechanisms behind its downregulation remain elusive [72],['RKIP']
31083461,Some evidence suggests that it mightbe downregulated through transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms such as promotormethylation [73 74] transcription inhibition through SNAIL [75] and BACH1 [76] or by microRNAssuch as miR-224 and miR-27a [77 78],['SNAIL']
31083461,Deletion or downregulation of RKIP has also been described in other pathologies suchas Alzheimer’s disease diabetic nephropathy sperm decapitation heart failure [53 54 79–81] or lung-associated pathologies [82–84],['RKIP']
31083461,Speciﬁcally RKIP has been implicated in asthma progressiondue to its interaction with epithelial 15-lipoxygenase 1 15LO1  a molecule that was shown to beoverexpressed in this disease,['RKIP']
31083461,Low levels of colocalization of Raf-1 and RKIP but high levels ofcolocalization of 15LO1 with RKIP were observed in human asthmatic tissues when compared withnormal tissue [82],['RKIP']
31083461,The interaction between 15LO1 and RKIP was described as a regulator of ferroptosis,['RKIP']
31083461,Hence the RKIP 15LO complex has great potential to be a new target for drug discovery against such diseases,['RKIP']
31083461,Additionally it has been shown in human bronchial epithelial cells that upon long-term exposure tocigarette smoke acetylcholine Ach levels are raised promoting the phosphorylation of RKIP ERK1 2and β2-adrenergic receptors by enhancing PI3 PKC RKIP Raf-ERK1 2 pathway activation [84],['RKIP']
31083461,Overall the previous reviewed data show that RKIP is an important modulator of relevantintracellular signaling pathways including MAPK which is controlled by EGFR  is both a driverand predictor of therapy response in lung cancer Table 1  and has an important role in normal lunghomeostasis,['RKIP']
31083461,RKIP and Lung Cancer: Literature Review,['RKIP']
31083461,Regarding RKIP expression and its clinical signiﬁcance in lung cancer we have found that thestudies available are still scarce and inconclusive and are not concordant among them summarized inTable 2 [85–90],['RKIP']
31083461,In general RKIP mRNA was detected in 41,['RKIP']
31083461,Additionally there is one study that assessed the expression levels of theinactive form of RKIP with phosphorylation at serine 153 pRKIP [90],['RKIP']
31083461,Furthermore the median percentage of RKIP positive cases is higher in IHC studies than in mRNA ones which isprobably also due to the variability and lower speciﬁcity of IHC Table 2,['RKIP']
31083461,RKIP is a well-established metastasis suppressor [63 91 92],['RKIP']
31083461,found a signiﬁcant reduction of RKIP mRNAexpression levels in tumor tissues when compared to the surrounding normal tissues which showed76,['RKIP']
31083461,7% 66 86 RKIP positivity Table 2 [85],['RKIP']
31083461,compared the expression levels of RKIP betweenlung tumor and normal tissues in a large series of samples 671 lung tissues by analyzing bothRKIP and pRKIP expression through an IHC approach [90],['RKIP']
31083461,The authors did not ﬁnd diﬀerencesin total RKIP expression levels between normal epithelium primary NSCLC or metastatic lesions but instead described a slight statistically signiﬁcant decrease in pRKIP expression in metastatic compared to nonmalignant lesions [90],['RKIP']
31083461,Looking deeply into the data the resultsare unexpected because by concept RKIP phosphorylation at serine 153 dissociates RKIP fromRaf-1 reversing its inhibitory function [51],['RKIP']
31083461,Recently using a diﬀerent antibody for total RKIP Wang A et al,['RKIP']
31083461,observed negative or weak stainingof RKIP in the majority of lung tumor tissues compared with the intense staining of noncanceroustissues as expected [89],['RKIP']
31083461,Furthermore even though they did not analyze RKIP expression in metastatictissues as in the Huerta-Yepez S et al,['RKIP']
31083461,study [90] the authors found a statistically signiﬁcant associationbetween low total RKIP protein expression levels and higher TNM stage and presence of lymph nodeand distant metastases [89] a result that is concordant with the remaining studies available either atthe mRNA [85 86] or protein level [87 88] Table 2,['RKIP']
31083461,Regarding the predictive role of RKIP in the prognosis of lung cancer patients Table 2  the resultsare also ambiguous,['RKIP']
31083461,[90] found that low levels of pRKIP werean independent poor prognostic marker while total levels of RKIP had no predictive value in theircohort of patients [90],['RKIP']
31083461,Interestingly the authors also showed that the RKIP expression level wasgenerally lower in radioresistant NSCLC tissues pointing out its putative role in radiotherapy responsemodulation [88],['RKIP']
31083461,The diﬀerence among the two studies is most likely because the ﬁrst study used tissuemicroarrays TMAs  which we showed previously was not the best way to study RKIP expressionbecause it requires the largest representative sample possible as loss of RKIP expression in primarytumors is essentially focal [47 55–57 59 97],['RKIP']
31083461,[90] used the same antibody from Millipore Upstate Biotechnology that we and other authors have used without problems [47 55–57 59 97]Importantly two distinct papers showed that RKIP expression levels are associated with theexpression of other cancer-related proteins in lung tumor tissues such as positive expression ofE-Cadherin [85] and negative expression of phosphorylated STAT3 [89],['RKIP']
31083461,The associations betweenRKIP E-cadherin and STAT3 are not novel and are also well described in other tumor types asreviewed in [62]  emphasizing the biological importance of studying RKIP in lung cancer as will bereviewed in the next section,['RKIP']
31083461,Although many questions remain regarding the best method to reliably detect RKIP expressionlevels in lung cancer most studies agree on the clear association between low expression of RKIP andhigher TNM stage or presence of lymph node metastases Table 2,['RKIP']

31083461,The ﬁrst evidence showing RKIP as a modulator of cell signaling in lung cancer came from in vitroexperiments using a KRAS adenocarcinoma mutated cell line A549 [89],['RKIP']
31083461,The authors demonstrated by lentiviral overexpression that RKIP decreases the levels of IL-6 dependent ERK and STAT3phosphorylation Figure 1 and consequently the cells migratory capacity [89],['RKIP']

31083461,The first evidence showing RKIP as a modulator of cell signaling in lung cancer came from in vitro experiments using a KRAS adenocarcinoma mutated cell line A549 [89],['RKIP']
31083461,The authors demonstrated by lentiviral overexpression that RKIP decreases the levels of IL-6 dependent ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation Figure 1 and consequently the cells migratory capacity [89] Furthermore it was demonstrated that RKIP acts as a physiological inhibitor of NOTCH1 a major player in EMT and metastases [98],['RKIP']
31083461,Using H1299 cells transfected to overexpress RKIP the authors demonstrated that RKIP directly interacts with the full-length of NOTCH1 preventing its proteolytic cleavage and NICD release Figure 1  decreasing EMT markers like Vimentin N-cadherin and Snail,"['SNAIL', 'RKIP']"

31083461,As a consequence the migratory and invasive capacity of the cells also decreased a phenotype thatwas reverted in vivo by RKIP knockdown in A549 cells [98],['RKIP']
31083461,Signaling axes involving RKIP and microRNAs were also described in NSCLC as importantmodulators of EMT and metastasis [77 99],['RKIP']
31083461,of RKIP miR-27a increases Vimentin expression as well as cell invasion capacity and decreasesE-cadherin levels [77],['RKIP']
31083461,Furthermore it was demonstrated that dysregulation of the miR-150-FOXO4axis promotes EMT through modulation of the NF-κB SNAIL YY1 RKIP loop [99],"['SNAIL', 'RKIP']"
31083461,In vitro assaysshowed that miR-150 downregulates FOXO4 resulting in increased levels of NF-κB and its targets SNAIL and YY which in turn will lead to RKIP downregulation [99],"['SNAIL', 'RKIP']"
31083461,RKIP was also identiﬁed as a p53 modulator in malignant pleural mesothelioma MPM  an asbestos-induced human lung cancer [100],['RKIP']
31083461,In this RKIP tumor-promoting context MAPK signaling activation andneuroﬁbromatosis 2 NF2 protein inactivation triggers SNAIL expression that ultimately leads to p53and E-cadherin inhibition Figure 1 [100],"['SNAIL', 'NF2', 'RKIP']"
31083461,Furthermore it was demonstrated that the expression levels of the signal transducer Smoothened SMO and Gli1 a zinc-ﬁnger transcription factor are decreased in RKIP knockdown cells pointingto RKIP as an inhibitor of Sonic Hedgehog Shh signaling [88],"['RKIP', 'GLI1']"
31083461,Consequently active SMO will trigger thetranscription of the Shh target gene Gli1 which acts as a transcriptional activator of numerousgenes regulating proliferation diﬀerentiation extracellular matrix interactions and cancer stem cell CSC activation [101],['GLI1']
31083461,Mechanistically RKIP binds to SMO keeping it inactive and preventing thetranscription of Gli1 Figure 1 [88],"['RKIP', 'GLI1']"
31083461,Finally as referred to before RKIP was established as a metastasis suppressor for the ﬁrst timein prostate cancer where it was reported that low RKIP expression in primary tumors increasesthe probability of lung metastasis development [63] a ﬁnding that was further demonstrated forother tumors of diﬀerent primary sites [102–105],['RKIP']
31083461,by using a breast cancer orthotopicmodel injected with RKIP expressing cells showed that tumors expressing RKIP formed less lungmetastases [102],['RKIP']
31083461,proposed that RKIP inhibits the occurrence of lung metastases through the regulation of the CCL5protein and the reduction of macrophage lung inﬁltration [103],['RKIP']
31083461,Similarly in the nasopharyngealcarcinomas RKIP downregulation promotes invasion metastasis and EMT by activating STAT3signaling [104],['RKIP']
31083461,Using a diﬀerent approach it was recently shown in the hepatocellular carcinomas that somatostatin octapeptide signiﬁcantly reduced the occurrence of pulmonary metastases in vivo byincreasing RKIP levels in the primary tumor [105],['RKIP']
31083461,RKIP Implications in Therapy Response,['RKIP']
31083461,RKIP has been reported as an important molecular player in the modulation of tumor cells resistantto conventional therapies however the mechanisms behind this remain largely unclear [106–109],['RKIP']
31083461,Concerning NSCLC it has already been reported in vitro that A549 cells treated with thechemotherapeutic agents adriamycin and 9NC increased RKIP expression in a time and dosedependent manner,['RKIP']
31083461,Activation of RKIP expression is in the case of adriamycin fully dependent on thep53 transcription factor which is able to bind to RKIP’s promotor at two diﬀerent binding sites [107],['RKIP']
31083461,Moreover gemcitabine another chemotherapeutic drug also induces RKIP expression not only inthe A549 cell line but also in the CALU-1 CALU-6 H23 and HCC 827 cell lines [110],['RKIP']
31083461,NF-κB activation was suggested by the authors to be a possible mechanism forgemcitabine-mediated RKIP induction a consequence of DNA damage induced by the same drug [110],['RKIP']
31083461,RKIP was further implicated in the mechanism through which miR27a regulates cisplatin resistancein the A549 cell line [77],['RKIP']
31083461,reported both in vitro and in vivo that miR27a appears to beincreased in cisplatin-resistant A549 cells when compared with the parental A549 cell line while RKIP which they report as a direct target of miR27a appears to be decreased,['RKIP']
31083461,RKIP knockdown in theA549 cell line decreased the sensitivity to cisplatin while ectopic expression of RKIP in part rescuedmiR27a-mediated resistance to cisplatin [77],['RKIP']
31083461,Importantly the authors were also able to demonstratean association between miR27a and RKIP expression with chemotherapeutic resistance using clinicaltumor tissue samples collected from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma [77],['RKIP']
31083461,through the analysis of RKIP expression in a series of human NSCLC tissuesdivided into radiosensitive and radioresistant reported that RKIP expression levels were positivelycorrelated with radiosensitivity [88],['RKIP']
31083461,Accordingly the authors demonstrated in vitro that both theA549 and SK-MES-1 cell lines with RKIP knockdown showed increased resistance to diﬀerent degreesof radiotherapy as well as lower radiation-induced apoptosis [88],['RKIP']
31083461,The modulation of the Shh pathway speciﬁcally its activation through RKIP depletion was one of the mechanisms proposed to explainradioresistance,['RKIP']
31083461,The authors demonstrated that in RKIP knockdown cells Gli1 overexpressionincreased the number of CSCs somehow explaining the observed radioresistance in vivo [88],"['RKIP', 'GLI1']"
31083461,RKIP and Lung Cancer: In Silico Analysis,['RKIP']
31083461,Recently Zaravinos A and colleagues by analyzing RKIP mRNA expression across 37 diﬀerentcancer types and using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA platform showed that RKIP isdownregulated compared to normal lung tissues with lung adenocarcinoma being among the eighttumor types with the lowest RKIP expression levels [62],['RKIP']
31083461,Another study using the same database suggested that RKIP downregulation in cancer is not due to genetic or mutation events but rather totranscriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms [61],['RKIP']
31083461,Even so breast cancers gliomas and NSCLCsseem to present the highest RKIP genetic heterogeneity among the 25 tumor types analyzed [61],['RKIP']

31083461,Regarding RKIP mutations all were found in exons2 and 3 at the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding domain of the protein Figure 2B,['RKIP']
31083461,Interestingly even though it is a rare event a signiﬁcant association was found between the presence of genomicalterations in the PEBP1 gene and a poor overall survival in NSCLC Figure 2C ; knowing this it couldbe interesting to include mutational and CNA analysis in the studies aiming to explore the prognosticvalue of RKIP in the future,['RKIP']
31083461,Regarding mRNA expression relative to RNA-seq data available from the TCGA PanCancerAtlas [112–117] we observed that SCC cases present lower mean levels of RKIP mRNA when comparedto AC Figure 2D,['RKIP']

31266248,Finally a recent investigation of 374 consecutive untreated metastatic EGFRM+ NSCLCs undertaken by thewide-targeted NGS platform used at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center MSKCC in NewYork found 200 cases with coexisting alterations the most frequent of which were mutations in TP53 PIK3CA CTNNB1 and RB1 and focal ampliﬁcations in EGFR TTF1 MDM2 CDK4 and FOXA1 [38],"['TP53', 'MDM2', 'RB1']"
31266248,Importantly ampliﬁcation of ERBB2 or MET or mutation in TP53 were signiﬁcantly associated with ashorter time to progression [38],['TP53']
31266248,Together these studies suggest that in untreated advanced EGFRM+NSCLC co-mutations in other cancer-drivers are much more frequent than previously anticipated andmay act as mechanisms of inherent resistance to geﬁtinib and erlotinib,['ACT']
31266248,MET also downregulates miR-103 and miR-203 which are negative regulators of EMT therebycontributing to EMT-mediated TKI-resistance [138],['EMT']

31266248,The co-mutations most frequently detected by widely applied targeted NGS-assays in this settingare those in the tumor suppressor gene TP53,['TP53']
31266248,Several TP53 mutantshave been reported to contribute to acquired TKI-resistance by interfering with the TKI-mediatedcell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [120–123],['TP53']
31266248,Yet with respect to intrinsic TKI-resistance several reportshave shown only a marginal not always signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of TP53 co-mutations on the ORof geﬁtinib- or erlotinib-treated EGFRM+ NSCLC-patients [51–53 117 118],['TP53']
31266248,Indeed analyses of larger cohorts ofpre-treatment EGFRM+ LAC samples not only conﬁrm that TP53 mutations are among the most frequent >50% concomitant alterations in this cancer type [12] but also show that they are associated withsigniﬁcantly faster tumor progression after treatment with EGFR-TKIs of all three generations [38 124],['TP53']
31266248,Thus co-mutations in TP53 may represent a mechanism of intrinsic TKI-resistance though the role ofdiﬀerent types of TP53-mutations remains to be elucidated,['TP53']

31266248,Further illustrating the incompletely deﬁned role of RAS genes in the complexity of inherentTKI-resistance we observed also an EGFRM+ case that concomitantly carried mutations in NRAS TP53 ERBB4 and DDR2 [51],['TP53']
31266248,Thiscan be followed by acquired resistance through diﬀerent mechanisms MET-ampliﬁcation loss ofERBB2-ampliﬁcation EMT [160],['EMT']
31266248,Aclear tendency towards worse outcome was seen in the enrolled patients whose tumors containedERBB2-mutations co-existing with mutations in alternative RTKs such as EGFR or ERBB3  membersof the RAS RAF MAPK pathway or in TP53 [157],['TP53']
31266248,The S239P ERBB4-mutation that we observed in our erlotinib-treated EGFR NRAS TP53 ERBB4 DDR2co-mutated case showing PR had not been previously reported in NSCLC [51],['TP53']
31266248,In contrast we identiﬁed an advanced EGFRM+ casewith co-mutations in the FGFR1 and TP53 genes which nonetheless did show OR to erlotinib [51],['TP53']
31266248,Inaddition oncogenic FGFR3-TACC3 fusions have been detected in a small subset of advanced LACs especially in cases with concomitant EGFR-mutations in which the FGFR3-alterations appear to act asbypass-mechanism substituting for EGFR signaling and are associated with resistance to EGFR-TKIsof all three generations [36 37 189–191],['ACT']
31266248,Phenotypic transformation to SCLC or SqCC and EMT with change to sarcomatoid phenotype aremechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs of all three generations that can occur in up to 15% ofEGFRM+ LACs during TKI-treatment and are associated with rapid clinical course [17 18 29 30 192 193],['EMT']
31266248,This frequent occurrence of mutationsin TP53 RB1 and PIK3CA is also typical of classic smoking-related SCLC [201] and was reportedin previous cases of LACs transforming to SCLC following TKI-therapy though the inactivationof the p53- and Rb1-signaling pathways more rarely may take place via other genetic epigeneticmechanisms [68 192 193],"['TP53', 'RB1']"
31266248,[200] the TKI-resistant SCLC clones emerged earlier andat much higher frequency from a founder LAC with complete homozygous inactivation of the tumorsuppressor genes RB1 and TP53 at baseline as compared to LACs with intact p53 and Rb1 function,"['TP53', 'RB1']"
31266248,Taken together the above-mentioned results provide evidence for TP53 and RB1 inactivationas predisposing factor for SCLC-transformation of EGFRM+ LACs and suggest that evaluatingthe mutational status of TP53 and RB1 at baseline might aid in foreseeing which LACs are moreprone to SCLC-transformation following EGFR-TKI therapy [195 197 200],"['TP53', 'RB1']"
31266248,LAC-to-SCLC transformation is observed just a few weeks after initiating EGFR-TKIs [68 195] and SCLCclones are detectable before TKI-treatment in LACs with TP53 and RB1 inactivation thereby justifyingthe inclusion of this phenotypic change among the possible mechanisms of intrinsic TKI-resistance,"['TP53', 'RB1']"
31266248,Finally they imply that TKIs may function as factors promotingthe SCLC-transformation especially in NSCLCs with inactivated TP53 and RB1 despite not beingessential for the phenotypic transition,"['TP53', 'RB1']"

31266248,EMT was initially reported in connection with cases of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs of1G or 2G <2% and is now being observed at an increased frequency after the implementation ofosimertinib [29],['EMT']
31266248,EMT is characterized by loss of epithelial markers e,['EMT']
31266248,As for the SCLC-transformation the possibility of NSCLCs containing sarcomatoid spindle cells that have undergone EMT and areintrinsically resistant to EGFR-TKIs prior to treatment cannot be omitted,['EMT']
31266248,Alternatively EMT mightbe induced very rapidly in some tumor cells after initiation of TKI-treatment as a form of adaptiveresponse to the inhibition of EGFR signaling [206],['EMT']
31266248,Experiments inNSCLC cell lines showed that counteracting EMT can re-establish sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs [207],['EMT']
31266248,However how EMT causes TKI-resistance remains uncertain,['EMT']
31266248,A key event in EMT appears tobe the downregulation of the EGFR-interacting adhesion-protein E-cadherin which is at least inpart mediated by epigenetic mechanisms,['EMT']
31266248,Moreover gene promoter methylation is also involved in E-cadherin downregulation when NSCLCundergoes EMT [208],['EMT']
31266248,Additionally cases of ALK-rearranged NSCLC resistant to the 2G ALK-TKIceritinib displaying features such as spindled cell shape loss of E-cadherin immunostaining andVimentin overexpression consistent with EMT have been documented [209],['EMT']
31266248,Similarly mutationsin genes regulating EMT and E-cadherin expression levels have been reported in crizotinib-resistantALK-positive NSCLCs [210],['EMT']
31266248,Thus a loss of E-cadherin expression in NSCLC appears to be predictiveof poor responsiveness to EGFR- and ALK-TKIs and is characteristic of EMT induction in NSCLCs thatbecome resistant to these drugs,['EMT']
31266248,Thus EMT may induce a TKI-resistant status at least in part via transcriptionalsuppression of BIM-mediated apoptosis,['EMT']
31266248,"An additional player contributing to the induction of EMT andEGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC cells is the teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 TDGF1  CRIPTO1,an oncofetal membrane-associated protein of the EGF-CFC family",['EMT']
31266248,Moreover ectopicexpression of CRIPTO1 in EGFRM+ NSCLC cell lines upregulated ZEB1 and activated the SRC pathwayvia microRNA-205 miR-205 downregulation thereby promoting EMT and erlotinib-resistance ofthese cells [215],['EMT']
31266248,Intriguingly miR-205 and the microRNA-200 family are known to repress the expression of ZEB1 ZEB2and SRC and in this way can prevent EMT and drug resistance [216 217],['EMT']
31266248,Also pharmacologically co-targeting EGFR and SRCsynergistically reduced the growth of CRIPTO1-positive erlotinib-resistant EGFRM+ NSCLC cells suggesting that this combination might be able to counteract intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs inpatients with CRIPTO1-positive EGFRM+ NSCLC undergoing EMT [215],['EMT']
31266248,MerTK functions as by-pass track and activates MAPK- andFAK-signaling thereby converging downstream EGFR while AXL-signaling has been associatedwith acquired resistance through the induction of EMT [227 228],['EMT']
31266248,Thus it would be relevant to investigatein biopsies obtained before treatment and early during response to therapy whether populationsof AXL-overexpressing cells exist in NSCLC at baseline as a source of rapid EMT developmentand primary TKI-resistance shortly after therapy initiation,['EMT']
31266248,This approach would also allow clinicalvalidation of the alternative possibility emerged from studies in TKI-treated NSCLC cell lines thatAXL and EMT are promptly induced as part of the rapid reprogramming these cells go through afterTKI-initiation,['EMT']
31266248,Cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts CAFs have been implicated in the induction through paracrinemechanisms of EMT and TKI-resistance in NSCLC,['EMT']
31266248,were able to promote EMT and EGFR-TKIresistance of the cancer cells,['EMT']
31266248,In turn the aberrantIGF1R-signaling favors the generation of primitive cancer stem cells and EMT whereas IGF1R-inhibitorscan revert these phenomena thus targeting IGF1R may have the potential to prevent hypoxia-inducedcancer progression EMT and ultimately TKI-resistance [234–236],['EMT']
31266248,In addition to transformation to SCLC and EMT there is mounting evidence for the association ofTKI-resistance with another phenotypic change namely the transition of an EGFRM+ LAC to a SqCCduring TKI-treatment,['EMT']
31266248,However as for SCLC-transformation and EMT it is debated whetherthe conversion from LAC to SqCC is a clonal selection or an adaptive histological change resulting inphenotype-switch [240],['EMT']
31266248,Thus it cannot be excluded that a certain amount of tumor cells with SqCCphenotype might already be present before the initiation of TKI-treatment and immediately act asmechanism of poor therapeutic response,['ACT']
31266248,As for the SCLC-transformation and EMT there is still a lack of markers capable of revealing thephenotypic change from LAC to SqCC in plasma samples during treatment with TKIs [7 242],['EMT']
31266248,An additional consideration from the above-mentioned results is that when the occurrenceof T790M in patients progressing on early generation EGFR-TKIs is determined only by mutationanalysis of plasma cfDNA before allocation to osimertinib treatment one may risk missing a possibleconcomitant transformation to SCLC or SqCC as well as cases with EMT or AXL overexpression thereby neglecting these causes of primary resistance to osimertinib [72 242],['EMT']
31266248,When feasible a tumor tissue re-biopsy should be performed together with aliquid re-biopsy given that cfDNA RNA from liquid biopsies can be problematic for the detection ofpotentially occurring gene fusions and cannot assess the presence of SCLC-transformation EMT ortrans-diﬀerentiation to SqCC [242],['EMT']
31266248,Indeed while sensitizingEGFR-mutations are prevalently occurring as early clonal events during NSCLC development most advanced NSCLCs possess heterogeneous regions harboring late clonal driver alterations thatcan represent TKI-resistance mechanisms such as mutations in TP53 and genes involved in theRAS-RAF-MAPK or PI3K-AKT-PTEN-mTOR pathways cell cycle regulation Wnt β-catenin pathway DNA damage repair chromatin remodeling and histone methylation [11 12],['TP53']

31404976,PI3K mTOR Akt is one of the most commonly geneticallyaltered and deregulated oncogenic signaling pathways in cancer including lung cancer and especiallyNSCLC,['PI3K']
31404976,At the end of the 1990s phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 PTEN was discovered as a tumor suppressor gene and thereafter it was demonstrated that it acts as a masternegative regulator of the PI3K mTOR Akt pathway,['PI3K']
31404976,PTEN Biology,['PTEN']
31404976,PTEN is one of the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor genes in cancer and its expressionis dramatically decreased in numerous cancer types [3],['PTEN']
31404976,PTEN was originally identiﬁed in 1997 whenindependent groups studying frequent mutations at the 10q23 locus in chromosome 10 suggestedPTEN as a candidate tumor suppressor gene [4],['PTEN']
31404976,The PTEN gene is structured by nine exons andencodes for a 403-aminoacid protein with dual lipid and protein phosphatase utility,['PTEN']
31404976,While othertumor suppressor genes follow the stepwise theory such as the hereditary or sporadic retinoblastoma  PTEN seems to escape from this classical two hit model and as was demonstrated in vivo even asubtle decrease of its levels could increase cancer susceptibility indicating a continuum for tumorsuppressor behavior [5 6],['PTEN']
31404976,The PI3K mTOR Akt pathway is a critical oncogenic signaling that controls a plethora of cellularevents,['PI3K']
31404976,Then the active PI3K phosphorylates the phosphatidylinositol-4 5-bisphosphate PIP2 generatingphosphatidylinositol-3 4 5-trisphosphate PIP3  which acts as a lipid second messenger stimulatingthe activation signals to Akt and mTOR complexes initiating cell proliferation survival and anabolicevents [8],['PI3K']
31404976,Physiologically PTEN patrols in proximity to this phosphorylation event preservinghomeostasis by removing a phosphate group from PIP3 and converting it back to the PIP2 inactive state,['PTEN']
31404976,In addition to this critical duty other important ﬁndings showed that PTEN facilitates fundamentalanti-oncogenic tasks such as maintenance of chromosomal stability and competence of DNA repair bypositively regulating the DNA repair protein RAD51 [9],['PTEN']
31404976,PTEN was described as forming homodimersfor acquiring the functional lipid phosphatase conﬁguration,['PTEN']
31404976,However PTEN mutants lack thecatalytical function associated with wild-type WT PTEN units and establish in a dominant negativemanner an inactive state,['PTEN']
31404976,Phosphorylation of PTEN C-tail inducesfolding and association with the rest of the protein body promoting a closed shape of PTEN shelling thebinding sites and thus negatively regulating its tumor suppressor function,['PTEN']
31404976,Nevertheless eradicationof the phosphorylation residues could restore PTEN to fully active conformation [11],['PTEN']
31404976,Interestingly both PTEN and PTEN-L an alternative less abundant transcriptional variant 173 amino acids longer were found to be secreted in the extracellular environment exerting their tumor suppressor propertiesinto the recipient cells in a cell autonomous manner a ﬁnding that might imply pharmaceutical utilityfor PTEN delivery Figure 1 [12–14],['PTEN']
31404976,"It is noteworthy that with the presence of two diﬀerent PTENpeptides two homodimers PTEN PTEN, PTEN-L PTEN-L and one heterodimer PTEN PTEN-L canbe formed likely enriching the spectrum of mediated activities [15]",['PTEN']

31404976,These rates cannot explain the high prevalence of PTEN protein loss usually observed in lung cancer samples [17 18],['PTEN']

31404976,PTEN mRNA is highly susceptible to post-transcriptional control by diﬀerent non-coding RNAs innumerous cancer types including NSCLC Table 1,['PTEN']
31404976,Indeed miRNAs directly targeting PTEN includemiR-524 in osteosarcoma miR-146b in thyroid cancer and miR-205 in NSCLC [24–27],['PTEN']
31404976,Recently lncRNAgrowth arrest-speciﬁc 5 GAS5 was reported to recognize and target miR-205 decreasing its levels andallowing PTEN to increase in NSCLC cell lines [28],['PTEN']
31404976,The miR-21 is frequently upregulated in numerouscancer types and has been reported to directly target and repress PTEN expression in NSCLC [29],['PTEN']
31404976,Furthermore higher expression levels of miR-328 and lower expression levelsof PTEN were detected in cisplatin resistant compared with cisplatin sensitive NSCLC patients [31],['PTEN']
31404976,Another oncomiRNA manipulating PTEN levels is miR-130b which was reported as increased inNSCLC cisplatin resistant cells,['PTEN']
31404976,Its function is based on PTEN downregulation with a subsequent promotion of theWnt β-catenin signaling axis [32],['PTEN']
31404976,Indeed PTEN has been described as a negative regulator ofWnt β-catenin in NSCLC and prostate cancer mainly by aﬀecting β-catenin function [33 34],['PTEN']
31404976,More examples of epigeneticregulation of PTEN involve miR-29b miR-92a miR-183-5p miR-374b miR-494 and miR-4286 [36–41],['PTEN']
31404976,Interestingly the transcripts of PTEN pseudogene 1 PTENP1 which share highly homologous regionswith PTEN have started to attract increasing research attention,['PTEN']
31404976,Due to the almost identical sequence PTENP1 transcripts act as a bait for miRNAs sacriﬁcing themselves for allowing PTEN mRNA toescape miRNA surveillance [42],['PTEN']

31404976,This ﬁnding highlights the negative regulatory role thatphosphorylation events exert on the tumor suppressive function of PTEN,['PTEN']
31404976,Interestingly phosphorylatedlevels of PTEN were higher in tumor tissue and were increasing with tumor grade,['PTEN']
31404976,Although PTEN creates an antioncogenic shield above diﬀerent factors there are also guardians ofPTEN protecting its function and stability,['PTEN']
31404976,CK1α is a PTEN interacting-protein which binds to theC-terminal tail with higher aﬃnity than any other kinases GSK3B CK2 therefore preventing itsphosphorylation,['PTEN']
31404976,Moreover the interaction of CK1α and PTEN antagonized NEDD4 binding thusabrogating the NEDD4-mediated PTEN polyubiquitination,['PTEN']
31404976,Interestingly NSCLC patients with highCK1α expression had a signiﬁcantly longer survival than those with low expression and this wasobserved only in PTEN-detectable group conﬁrming the close association of PTEN with CK1α [46],['PTEN']
31404976,Another guardian of the PTEN protein is Importin-11 IPO-11  which mediates and is required forPTEN nuclear translocation,['PTEN']
31404976,Genetic perturbation of IPO-11 resulted in increased polyubiquitinationand degradation of PTEN in cytoplasm due to its insuﬃcient import to nucleus,['PTEN']
31404976,Moreover IPO-11absence or malfunction allows NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase to approach and degrade PTEN,['PTEN']

31404976,In addition PTEN deletion and low PTEN protein expression are strong andindependent predictors of worse PFS in EGFR-TKI treated NSCLC patients [101],['PTEN']
31404976,Moreover high PTENexpression seems to contribute to prolonged survival in geﬁtinib-treated NSCLC patients while EGFRmutant patients with concomitant elevated PTEN expression showed the longest survival compared toother subgroups [102],['PTEN']

31404976,Intriguingly large cohort studies analyzing human lung cancersamples showed decreased and complete loss of PTEN expression for 40% of cases approximately,['PTEN']
31404976,However genetic alterations of PTEN mutations deletion in lung cancer do not match the protein lossprevalence and therefore non-genomic mechanisms regulating PTEN expression should exist,['PTEN']

31438559,Although ADAM17 activation has been studied extensivelysince it has been discovered the molecular mechanisms by which cell signals stimulate ADAM17 haveremained ambiguous,['ADAM17']
31438559,Indeed how ADAM17 is activated is still puzzling molecular biologists and thecomplexities of its regulation have been reported extensively previously [118 138 139] and for thisreason will only be brieﬂy discussed below,['ADAM17']
31438559,ADAM17 is synthesized as a catalytically inactive full-length precursor in the endoplasmicreticulum ER,['ADAM17']
31438559,In the trans-Golgi network this pro-form of ADAM17 undergoes a maturation step which requires its inhibitory N-terminal prodomain—acting as a molecular chaperone for ADAM17—tobe cleaved oﬀ by pro-protein convertase furin protease  resulting in a catalytically active mature formof ADAM17 [140 141],['ADAM17']
31438559,ADAM17 prodomain has been shown to interact and inhibit the catalytic domainof ADAM17 thus abrogating speciﬁcally ADAM17 surface activity [142],['ADAM17']
31438559,Indeed a stable form of theADAM17 prodomain attenuated ADAM17-mediated disease models of sepsis rheumatoid arthritisand inﬂammatory bowel disease via inhibiting TNFα secretion thus providing in vivo evidence as apotential new highly selective inhibitor of ADAM17 [143],['ADAM17']
31438559,The rhomboid protease family members iRhoms  which are polytopic non-catalytic rhomboid-likeintramembrane proteases have emerged as critical regulators of constitutive and inducible sheddingactivity of ADAM17 [144–148],['ADAM17']
31438559,Indeed mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts MEFs lacking both iRhom1and iRhom2 are devoid of ADAM17 shedding activity [144 146],['ADAM17']
31438559,iRhom2 has been reported tomediate the traﬃcking of ADAM17 from the ER which is suggested to be the rate-limiting step forADAM17 maturation [145] and consequently regulating ADAM17 shedding activity [144 149],['ADAM17']
31438559,Here the transmembrane domain of ADAM17 is suggested to be required for the binding of ADAM17 toiRhom2 [144],['ADAM17']
31438559,Further evidence for a key role of iRhom2 in regulating ADAM17 is the observation thatwhile functional ADAM17 has been detected in exosomes inhibition of iRhom2 suppressed exosomalADAM17 release [150] Figure 8,['ADAM17']

31438559,Overview of ADAM17 activity regulation,['ADAM17']

31438559,The phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 also plays a pivotal role in controllingits sheddase activity,['ADAM17']
31438559,Speciﬁcally phosphorylation of Threonine 735 residue Thr735 by MAPKs including ERK and p38 MAPK can enhance ADAM17 shedding activity and this ERK-mediated Thr735,['ADAM17']
31438559,phosphorylation can also induce ADAM17 traﬃcking to the cell membrane [151–155] [156],['ADAM17']
31438559,Of note cellular senescence is associated with ADAM17-mediated release of amphiregulin and TNF receptorsfrom the surface of senescent cells via p38 MAPK-induced phosphorylation of ADAM17 cytoplasmictail [157],['ADAM17']
31438559,Another regulatory mechanism of ADAM17 activity involves tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 TIMP3  which inhibits ADAM17 activity via interacting with its ectodomain [158 159],['ADAM17']
31438559,Indeed geneticablation of TIMP3 enhances ADAM17 activity and TNFα shedding leading to inflammation [160],"['TIMP3', 'ADAM17']"
31438559,Theactivity of ADAM17 can also be regulated via dimerization involving its cytoplasmic domain alsorequired for its interaction with TIMP3  and ADAM17 can be present as dimers at the cell surface duringsteady states [154],['ADAM17']
31438559,With respect to the above-mentioned regulation by MAPKs upon activation by ERKor p38 MAPK signaling ADAM17 dimers dissociate and ADAM17 is presented as monomers allowingfor the release of TIMP3 [154],"['TIMP3', 'ADAM17']"
31438559,Other mechanisms of regulating ADAM17 activity include the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton probably via a mechanism independent of p38 MAPK or ERK-induced ADAM17 phosphorylation [161],['ADAM17']
31438559,In this scenario the actin-binding protein ﬁlamin has been proposed to regulate ADAM17 activitysince disrupting the ADAM17–ﬁlamin interaction inhibited ectodomain shedding of CD44 and amyloidprotein precursor [162],['ADAM17']
31438559,Additional mechanisms of ADAM17 regulation albeit ill-deﬁned involvethe tetraspanin CD9 redox modiﬁcations of the cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups in mature ADAM17 i,['ADAM17']
31438559,ADAM17 activity could alsobe regulated during its transport to Golgi apparatus by sequestering in lipid rafts since depletion ofmembrane cholesterol enhances ADAM17-dependent shedding of TNFα and TNF receptors [166],['ADAM17']
31438559,has proposed that ADAM17 substrate selectivity may be modulatedby certain signaling pathways in response to the inducers PMA and angiotensin II irrespective ofenhanced ADAM17 protease activity [167],['ADAM17']
31438559,Activation of PKC-α and the PKC-regulated proteinphosphatase 1 inhibitor 14D is required for ADAM17 cleavage of TGF-α HB-EGF and amphiregulin while PKC-δ is required for NRG release [167],['ADAM17']
31438559,Moreover a juxtamembrane segment in the extracellulardomain of the ADAM17 regulated by a protein-disulﬁde isomerase has been identiﬁed as a sensorthat binds IL-6R but not TNFα and mediates its shedding [168],['ADAM17']
31438559,These studies indicate that substrateselection by ADAM17 could be inﬂuenced in certain settings by diﬀerent mechanisms,['ADAM17']
31438559,ADAM17 and Its Role in Cancer,['ADAM17']
31438559,Since ADAM17 mediates the ectodomain shedding of various pro-tumourigenic cytokines growthfactors and surface receptors [138] it is of no surprise that ADAM17 has attracted attention as apotential driver of cancer,['ADAM17']
31438559,In support of this notion ADAM17 is overactivated or overexpressed innumerous human cancers including NSCLC and its major LAC subtype  colon carcinoma breastcancer hepatocellular carcinoma HNSCC and gastric cancer [29 169–177],['ADAM17']
31438559,Some of the therapeutic agents thatwere developed to inhibit ADAM17 are summarized in Table 2,['ADAM17']
31438559,A summary of some therapeutic inhibitors of ADAM17,['ADAM17']
31438559,Despite the success of targeting ADAM17 using small-molecule inhibitors SMIs and siRNAin cancer models the clinical beneﬁts of such approaches are questionable,['ADAM17']
31438559,hydroxamates such as GW280264X to inhibit ADAM17 is their non-speciﬁcity sincethey target other proteases e,['ADAM17']
31438559,For example potent non-selectiveinhibitors of ADAM17 and ADAM10 such as INCB3619 and INCB7839 aderbasib  have shownpromise in reducing tumour growth alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agentswhen tested in preclinical models of breast cancer and NSCLC [182–184 189],['ADAM17']
31438559,In addition using siRNA to inhibit ADAM17 expression is problematic to translate and isconsidered a questionable approach since suppressing ADAM17 expression does not necessarily aﬀectits activity [191 192],['ADAM17']
31438559,Similarly transgenic over-expression of ADAM17 in mice including in the lung does not result in increased shedding i,['ADAM17']
31438559,protease activity thus indicating that ADAM17 activity isnot dependent on its transcriptional regulation [193],['ADAM17']
31438559,Therefore there is a clear need to identify anddevelop new non-toxic and selective inhibitors of ADAM17,['ADAM17']
31438559,In this regard the ADAM17 prodomainhas been identiﬁed as a potent inhibitor of ADAM17 surface activity which signiﬁcantly reducedtumour burden in LAC models [29 131],['ADAM17']
31438559,In addition the recent advent of speciﬁc antibodies to inhibitADAM17 activity provides another avenue to speciﬁcally target ADAM17 whilst minimizing anyoﬀ-target eﬀects [180],['ADAM17']
31438559,ADAM17 and Its Substrates in Lung Cancer,['ADAM17']
31438559,While the role of ADAM17 and its speciﬁc substrates e,['ADAM17']
31438559,However it has been suggestedthat the transmembrane form of the ligand could activate EGFR via juxtacrine signaling only after itsshedding via ADAM17 [195],['ADAM17']
31438559,Nonetheless these data place ADAM17 at the centre of EGFR signaling,['ADAM17']
31438559,In addition tobaccosmoke exposure to NSCLC cell lines can enhance ADAM17 activation culminating in the releaseof amphiregulin and EGFR activation [165],['ADAM17']
31438559,Although Notch1 is a substrate of both ADAM10 and ADAM17 it has been suggested thatADAM10 can only process the ligand-associated receptor while ADAM17 cleavage activity is,['ADAM17']
31438559,Moreover ADAM17 is shown to berequired for the proteolysis of Notch1 receptor which enhances EGFR expression and EGFR-dependentactivation of ERK but not AKT in NSCLC cell lines in vitro [187],"['AKT', 'ADAM17']"
31438559,Previous studies have mainly focused on EGFR family ligands and the Notch receptor asdownstream processed substrates of ADAM17,['ADAM17']
31438559,Given that ADAM17 sheds over 70 substrates therelies the need to investigate the potential role of other ADAM17 substrates in cancer,['ADAM17']
31438559,In this respect IL-6 trans-signaling via sIL-6R has recently emerged as a central driver of Kras mutant LAC andCRC the latter via EGFR signaling which paves the way to potentially exploit components of the IL-6trans-signaling axis including ADAM17 as therapeutic targets in patients who develop resistance toEGFR blockade [29 97 132 197],['ADAM17']
31438559,IL-6trans-signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous inﬂammatory conditions andmalignancies the latter including those to which ADAM17 has also been associated with namely CRC pancreatic cancer and lung cancer [29 97 213–217],['ADAM17']
31438559,ADAM17 cleave mIL-6R to release soluble s IL-6R which then binds to free IL-6 to form a signal-transducing receptor complex with gp130,['ADAM17']

31438559,In this regard ADAM17 is overactivated via p38 MAPK-mediated threonine phosphorylation following which activated ADAM17 drives the preferential processing of the sIL-6R which induces lung cancer cell proliferation through ERK1 2 MAPK activation,['ADAM17']

31544066,All these functions are regulated by a number of events here summarized in threemajor points that cooperate with mutant Kras in metabolic reprogramming and specify metabolicadaptation in diﬀerent tumor types,['KRAS']
31544066,i Similarly to other oncogenic lesions 2  the eﬀect of KRAS mutations in metabolic adaptationcan diﬀer in distinct tumor types depending on the tissue of origin,['KRAS']
31544066,This has been revealed bycomparing the metabolic adaptations of non-small cell lung carcinoma NSCLC and pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma PDAC driven by Kras mutations and Trp53 deletion in mice,['KRAS']
31544066,ii Cancer cells carrying mutant Kras crosstalk with themicroenvironment exchanging cytokines growth factors andmetabolites to improve metabolic adaptation and overcome lownutrients availability 4–6,['KRAS']
31544066,iii Finally a number of concomitant genetic alterations havebeen shown to cooperate with KRAS mutations in sustainingspeciﬁc metabolic adaptations 7–10,['KRAS']
31544066,In this framework the purpose of this review is to discussthe most recent ﬁndings on the interplay between Kras andmetabolism focusing on metabolic dependencies of mutant Kras-driven lung and pancreatic cancers that could be attractive astherapeutic targets,['KRAS']
31544066,MUTANT KRAS AND GLUCOSEMETABOLISM,['KRAS']
31544066,In pancreatic cancer KRAS mutationsare an early event being detectable in the initial lesions known aspancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias PanIN  which can progressin inﬁltrating ductal carcinomas through the acquisition ofadditional genetic alterations 12,['KRAS']
31544066,In mouse models PanINlesions rapidly evolve in aggressive PDACs when Kras mutationsare combined with Trp53 loss 13,['KRAS']
31544066,Indeed inthe Kras mutant NSCLC model inhibition of increased lactateproduction which results from high rates of glycolysis severelyimpacts on disease progression 14,['KRAS']
31544066,Moreover increasedexpression of the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT1 whichfosters glycolysis by increasing glucose uptake 15  can beinvariably detected in Kras mutant pancreatic lesions 16 17  Figure 1,['KRAS']
31544066,Indeed elevation ofglycolysis by Kras channels glucose intermediates in the pentosephosphate pathway PPP and in the hexosamine biosynthesispathway 21,['KRAS']
31544066,In agreement inhibition of PPP suppresses xenografttumor growth indicating that mutant Kras by increasing glucoseuptake and consumption sustains biosynthetic pathways leadingto nucleotide production ﬁnally maintaining tumor growth 21,['KRAS']
31544066,Interestingly nucleosides supplementation can rescue cell deathcaused by Kras knockdown in mutant Kras-addicted PDAC celllines without promoting cell proliferation suggesting that themetabolic function of Kras can be uncoupled from its functionsin proliferation 22,['KRAS']
31544066,In pancreatic cancer overexpressionof paraoxonase 2 PON2  a target of p53 transcriptionalrepression has been found to join forces with mutant Kras toelevate glycolysis,['KRAS']
31544066,PON2 overexpression controlsthe cell starvation response and increases glucose uptaketo protect pancreatic cancer cells from detachment-inducedcell death which in part occurs through suppression ofthe AMPK FOXO3A PUMA signaling pathway 7,['AMPK']
31544066,AMPK isa highly conserved kinase that works as a sensor of lowcellular energy and that can either repress or promote tumorgrowth depending on tumor type and context 23,['AMPK']
31544066,Here pharmacological activation of the AMPK pathway inhibitsgrowth of tumors generated by subcutaneous injection ofPDAC cancer cells revealing a potential metabolic druggablevulnerability 7,['AMPK']
31544066,SCAVENGING PATHWAYS AND AMINOACID METABOLISM IN KRAS MUTANTCANCER CELLS,['KRAS']
31544066,KRAS mutations are known to stimulate processes such asmacropinocytosis and autophagy that can scavenge nutrientsfrom respectively external and internal compartments tosustain cancer cell survival under condition of nutrientdeprivation [reviewed in Kimmelman 1 ],['KRAS']
31544066,Interestingly both in Kras mutant lung and pancreatic cancers the lysosomal compartment undergoes expansion thanks to theincreased activity of the transcription factors Tfeb Tfe3 25 26  which are responsible for lysosomal biogenesis 27 28,"['TFE3', 'KRAS']"
31544066,InKras-driven NSCLC glucose starvation activates AMPK thatpromotes dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Tfeband Tfe3 25,"['TFE3', 'AMPK']"
31544066,Accordingly Tfe3 activity is required for growthof mouse lung tumors and increased expression of lysosomalgenes correlates with accelerated disease recurrence in human,['TFE3']
31544066,Similarly upregulation andincreased nuclear residence of Tfe3 sustain pancreatic tumorgrowth 26,['TFE3']
31544066,KRAS mutations have been shown to stimulatemacropinocytosis allowing for large uptake of albumin themost abundant serum protein which is degraded in lysosomesto increase the intracellular pool of amino acids 30 31,['KRAS']
31544066,Breakdown of albumin provides amino acids that feed the centralcarbon metabolism 30 and among them glutamine is avidlyused by Kras transformed cells for anaplerosis and nucleotideproduction 30 32 Figure 2,['KRAS']
31544066,Indeed in Kras mutantpancreatic cancer cells glutamine is the major carbon sourceand is consumed via a non-canonical pathway,['KRAS']
31544066,Kras drives the alternative glutamineconsumption pathway by up regulating transcription of GOT1and reducing expression of GLUD1,"['KRAS', 'GLUD1']"
31544066,Along this line Kras mutantcells that have become resistant to cisplatin a compound thatworks by increasing the reactive oxygen species in the cytoplasm display elevation of glutamine consumption and anti-oxidant,['KRAS']
31544066,FIGURE 2 | The cartoon schematizes some of the effects of mutant Kras in reprogramming amino acid metabolism,['KRAS']
31544066,The cytoplasm of the cell has been colored in blue in the background to highlight the role of mutant Kras in PDAC in pink to represent pathways revealed in NSCLC in yellow when the mechanisms are common to both tumor types,['KRAS']
31544066,Kras potentiates both macropinocytosis and autophagy whose vesicles end up in lysosomes a compartment that is frequently found enlarged in Kras mutant cancer cells,['KRAS']
31544066,In NSCLC in condition of low glucose this occurs by activating AMPK that phosphorylates Tfe3 resulting in its nuclear translocation and transcription of lysosomal genes,"['TFE3', 'AMPK']"
31544066,Moreover AMPK activation increases autophagy initiation and maturation,['AMPK']
31544066,In NSCLC mutant Kras activates the PI3K AKT pathway that in condition of low glutamine favors mRNA expression of the ATF4 transcription factor via the NRF2 factor,"['NRF2', 'KRAS', 'ATF4']"
31544066,In addition NRF2 is also a key regulator of genes involved in the antioxidant response,['NRF2']
31544066,Under condition of asparagine deprivation the GCN2-eIF2 pathway prompts transduction of the ATF4 mRNA into protein which in turn activates the transcription of amino acids transporters and glutamine consuming enzymes,['ATF4']
31544066,The role of Kras in detoxiﬁcation is also reported in advancedlung cancer where high frequency of KrasG12D copy gain isobserved,['KRAS']
31544066,"Indeed pancreatic deletion of the autophagy gene Atg5 in amodel of pancreatic cancer driven by oncogenic Kras and thestochastic loss of heterozygosity of Trp53 KrasG12D; Trp53lox + ,a condition that reproduces the stepwise human developmentof pancreatic cancer increases the number of PanIN lesions",['KRAS']
31544066,Moreover inhibition of autophagy bytreatment with hydroxycloroquine causes tumor reductionin KRAS mutant TP53 mutant patients-derived pancreaticcancer xenografts 42,['KRAS']
31544066,Theeﬃcacy of combining these two treatments appears to rely onthe fact that inhibition of the MAPK pathway one of the majorpathways downstream KRAS potentiates autophagy suggestingthat this treatment causes addiction to autophagy,['KRAS']
31544066,The ability of mutant Kras to model the microenvironmentis a long standing observation in PDACs where abrogationof KrasG12D expression not only aﬀects tumor growth butalso reduces the desmoplastic stroma which is typical of thistype of cancer 18,['KRAS']
31544066,In PDACs mutant Kras instructs themicroenvironment to sustain tumor growth both by engagingstromal cells that instigate reciprocal signaling 4  and byexploiting stroma-derived alternative fuels 6,['KRAS']
31544066,The role of Kras in mediating the nutrient stress response toreduced amino acid availability has been recently elucidated inNSCLC,['KRAS']
31544066,Gene expression proﬁles of lung cancer cell lines withdiﬀerent genetic background have been analyzed in presenceof high or low glutamine concentrations with or withoutconcomitant Kras knockdown to identify a set of genes that arediﬀerentially regulated by Kras signaling in response to glutamineavailability 45,['KRAS']
31544066,In low glutamine Kras regulates over 100 genes,['KRAS']
31544066,Kras increases the expression of ATF4 mRNA throughPI3K-AKT-mediated upregulation of the NRF2 transcriptionfactor which drives the expression of a number of genes mainlyinvolved in the antioxidant response [reviewed in Sullivan et al,"['NRF2', 'KRAS', 'ATF4']"
31544066,During nutrient deprivation activation of the GCN2-p-eIF2 pathway stimulates translation of the ATF4 mRNA resulting in increased ATF4 protein levels and transcription oftarget genes responsible for amino acids uptake and metabolismthus regulating cell proliferation and mTORC1 activation 45,['ATF4']
31544066,Among the ATF4 targets the enzyme asparagine synthetase ASNS  which transfers the γ amino group of glutamineto aspartate yielding asparagine and glutamate uncovers akey role because it contributes to apoptotic suppression protein biosynthesis and mTORC1 activation,['ATF4']
31544066,Overall these ﬁndings identify KRAS as a masterregulator of the transcriptional response to nutrient deprivationthat controls amino acids uptake and consumption schematizedin Figure 2,['KRAS']
31544066,ATF4 has been shown to exert both pro- and anti-oncogenic eﬀects depending on the genetic context and nutrientavailability 45,['ATF4']
31544066,In condition of low glutamine ATF4 has aprotective role toward apoptosis in Kras mutant NSCLC celllines that carry loss of KEAP1 45  a deletion that in humans aﬀects approximately 20% of Kras-mutant lung adenocarcinomas 8,"['KRAS', 'ATF4']"
31544066,Its loss cooperateswith KRAS mutations in lung adenocarcinoma progression byopposing to the oxidative stress barriers during tumorigenesis 8,['KRAS']
31544066,Of note Kras mutant Keap1 deﬁcient cancers are dependenton the glutamine anaplerotic pathway as their growth rate inmice is reduced by pharmacological inhibition of the enzymeglutaminase,['KRAS']
31544066,This suggests that increased NRF2 activation inKras mutant lung cancer might be exploited as a stratiﬁcation toolto identify patients that beneﬁt from glutaminase inhibition 8,['NRF2']
31544066,In NSCLC KRAS mutations are often accompanied byloss of the tumor suppressor STK11 which encodes theLKB1 kinase leading to the formation of aggressive tumorscharacterized by perturbed nitrogen handling 9,['KRAS']

31988639,Inlung cancer disease the sustained activation of ERK is a common event and frequentlycontributes the tumor growth and even the metastatic processes; therefore it might bean efficient way to abolish the enhanced Ras protein level or Ras-GTP activity by inhi-biting its E3 ubiquitin ligase i,['ERK']

31988639,However ubiquitination is completely essential for AKT signaling acti-vation,['AKT']
31988639,For instance K63-linked ubiquitination mediated by NEDD4–1 [125] Skp2[59] and TRAF6 [59 126] which itself could be negatively mediated by c-Cbl [127] induces AKT activation via promoting plasma membrane translocation and nucleartranslocation,"['AKT', 'TRAF6']"
31988639,Converse evidence suggests that TRAF4 but not Skp2 is required forAKT K63 ubiquitination and promotes EGF-induced AKT membrane recruitment inhuman lung cancer cells to induce tumorigenic properties [60] but TRAF6 is un-necessary for EGF-induced AKT activation [59 60],"['AKT', 'TRAF6']"

31988639,However PTEN is not frequently targeted at the genetic level in the development of lung cancer and mutations of the PTEN gene in patients harboring NSCLC have been reported in 8to 17% [135],['PTEN']
31988639,On the other hand PTMs of PTEN that regulate its enzymatic activity interaction with other proteins and subcellular localization have been strongly impli-cated in the regulation of the PI3K AKT pathway [57 135 142 143],"['AKT', 'PTEN']"
31988639,The PTEN pro-tein level is controlled to a large extent by E3 ligase-mediated UPS degradation [55];therefore stabilizing PTEN protein level is a promising therapeutic strategy for mostcancer diseases including NSCLC,['PTEN']

32498260,Furthermore as we also showed primary cilia-NRF2 connections are bidirectional as NRF2 aﬀectsciliogenesis and Hh signaling both of which it regulates transcriptionally [58 59],['NRF2']
32498260,Interestingly though while we found a positive eﬀect of NRF2 on cilia and Hh signaling [58 59] a very recent study founda negative connection instead [58 59],['NRF2']
32498260,In the remainder of this paper we will review the reciprocalfunctional interactions between primary cilia and NRF2 discussing their possible pathophysiologicalmeanings and proposing possible explanations where the evidence appears contradictory,['NRF2']
32498260,Primary Cilia Downregulation of NRF2 via Autophagy,['NRF2']
32498260,As with cilia autophagy’s connection to NRF2 also goes both ways,['NRF2']
32498260,On the one hand NRF2 stimulates autophagy gene expression raising autophagic ﬂux [55 56],['NRF2']
32498260,On the other hand KEAP1-dependent NRF2 levels are controlled by p62 sequestosome 1 SQSTM1  an autophagy cargoreceptor that traﬃcs ubiquitinated proteins to autophagosomes [71–74],['NRF2']
32498260,Phosphorylated p62then targets KEAP1 for autophagic degradation thus activating NRF2 which proceeds to activate itstarget genes including p62 SQSTM1 itself leading to a positive feedback loop whose malfunction isimplicated in cancer and neurodegeneration [71–76],"['NRF2', 'KEAP1']"
32498260,Conversely increased autophagy reduces p62levels and is associated with increased NRF2 inhibition as seen with the PAN axis Figure 3 [57],['NRF2']
32498260,However as hESC diﬀerentiation toneuroectoderm begins G1 lengthening allows primary cilia formation during G1 which sets thePAN axis in motion leading in succession to a rise in autophagy ﬂux reduced p62 levels NRF2transcriptional activity decrease OCT4 and NANOG downregulation and expression of PAX6 andother neuroectoderm markers Figure 3 [57],['PAX6']
32498260,Moreover the abnormally high NRF2 activity in cilia-null MEFs canbe rescued with mTOR inhibitors which raise autophagic ﬂux in these cells as in many others  as assessed by the chloroquine-induced rise in LC3B-II   LC3B-I ratio a measure of how fastMAP1LC3B microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B  an autophagy receptor and substrate isdegraded in autophagolysosomes [58],['NRF2']
32498260,Together with our ﬁnding that Hh signaling is not involved incilia-dependent NRF2 regulation in MEFs these data indicate that in both MEFs and hESCs primarycilia downregulate NRF2 activity by stimulating autophagy Figures 3 and 4  consistent with theabove-mentioned studies where the cilia-autophagy and autophagy-NRF2 connections were separatelyanalyzed [55–58 64 65 73 74],['NRF2']
32498260,transcriptional targets Gclc Hmox1 and Nqo1 indicating that primary cilia repress NRF2 in both contexts [57 58],['NRF2']
32498260,Moreover the abnormally high NRF2 activity in cilia-null MEFs can be rescued with mTOR inhibitors which raise autophagic flux in these cells as in many others  as assessed by the chloroquine-induced rise in LC3B-II   LC3B-I ratio a measure of how fast MAP1LC3B microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B  an autophagy receptor and substrate is degraded in autophagolysosomes [58],['NRF2']
32498260,Together with our finding that Hh signaling is not involved in cilia-dependent NRF2 regulation in MEFs these data indicate that in both MEFs and hESCs primary cilia downregulate NRF2 activity by stimulating autophagy Figures 3 4  consistent with the above-mentioned studies where the cilia-autophagy and autophagy-NRF2 connections were separately analyzed [55–58 64 65 73 74],['NRF2']
32498260,For instance how does increased autophagy reduce NRF2 activity in hESCs and MEFs? As mentioned above higher autophagy levels should lead to lower p62 levels which in turn would lead to higher KEAP1 and lower NRF2 protein levels,"['NRF2', 'KEAP1']"
32498260,Consistently p62 and KEAP1 proteins were indeed decreased and increased respectively upon neuroectoderm differentiation of hESCs in which NRF2 protein was not examined [57],"['NRF2', 'KEAP1']"
32498260,In our study we did not examine p62 or KEAP1 in cilia-null MEFs but we did look at NRF2 protein levels which to our surprise were not appreciably altered [58],"['NRF2', 'KEAP1']"
32498260,If confirmed this would suggest that the increased NRF2 activity in Kif3a− − MEFs may not be mediated by the p62-KEAP1 pathway,['NRF2']
32498260,Known mechanisms affecting NRF2 activity independently of its levels include changes in the levels of its binding partners such as the small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma sMAF factors or changes in NRF2 subcellular localization as occurs in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome where progerin a lamin A mutant retains NRF2 at the nuclear periphery [53],['NRF2']
32498260,Further studies are warranted to elucidate the details of how cilia affect NRF2 activity,['NRF2']
32498260,According to this hypothesis intact cilia would promote high levels of basal autophagy and low levels of Nrf2 activity,['NRF2']
32498260,This status quo would be disrupted by perturbations in ciliary structure or function leading to NRF2 activity upregulation which would help cells fix the problem for instance by inducing ciliary gene expression,['NRF2']
32498260,This could help explain for example some features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD  where NRF2 cytoprotection is enlisted downstream of cilia damage [77],['NRF2']
32498260,If the PAN axis is functional in these cells one would predict NRF2 activity to be kept at low levels by this pathway and to rise upon pathway disruption as may occur in PKD [20 80],['NRF2']
32498260,Although this remains speculative some evidence links NRF2 to kidney cystogenesis [81],['NRF2']
32498260,a In wild type WT MEFs the PAN axis functions to keep NRF2 transcriptional activity low as reﬂected in low expression of NRF2 targets Hmox1 Gclc and Nqo1,['NRF2']
32498260,b In MEFs KO for essential ciliogenic genes such as Kif3a or Ift88 lack of cilia leads to lower levels of autophagy and higher NRF2 target gene expression levels,['NRF2']
32498260,c Treatment of KO MEFs with mTOR inhibitors rapamycin or torin-1 increases their autophagy levels and restores NRF2 target expression to normal low levels [58],['NRF2']
32498260,For instance how does increased autophagy reduce NRF2activity in hESCs and MEFs? As mentioned above higher autophagy levels should lead to lowerp62 levels which in turn would lead to higher KEAP1 and lower NRF2 protein levels,"['NRF2', 'KEAP1']"
32498260,Consistently p62 and KEAP1 proteins were indeed decreased and increased respectively upon neuroectodermdiﬀerentiation of hESCs in which NRF2 protein was not examined [57],"['NRF2', 'KEAP1']"
32498260,In our study we did notexamine p62 or KEAP1 in cilia-null MEFs but we did look at NRF2 protein levels which to oursurprise were not appreciably altered [58],"['NRF2', 'KEAP1']"
32498260,Known mechanismsaﬀecting NRF2 activity independently of its levels include changes in the levels of its binding partners such as the small musculoaponeurotic ﬁbrosarcoma sMAF factors or changes in NRF2 subcellularlocalization as occurs in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome where progerin a lamin A mutant retains NRF2 at the nuclear periphery [53],['NRF2']
32498260,Further studies are warranted to elucidate the details ofhow cilia aﬀect NRF2 activity,['NRF2']
32498260,This status quo would be disrupted by perturbations in ciliary structure or function leadingto NRF2 activity upregulation which would help cells ﬁx the problem for instance by inducingciliary gene expression,['NRF2']

32498260,If the PAN axis is functionalin these cells one would predict NRF2 activity to be kept at low levels by this pathway and to riseupon pathway disruption as may occur in PKD [20 80],['NRF2']
32498260,Although this remains speculative someevidence links NRF2 to kidney cystogenesis [81],['NRF2']
32498260,NRF2 Upregulation of Primary Cilia and Hh,['NRF2']
32498260,Given the above-described bidirectional relationships between primary cilia and autophagy on the one hand and between NRF2 and autophagy on the other we hypothesized the PAN axiscould function backwards with NRF2 aﬀecting cilia via autophagy or NAP axis [55–58 64 65 73 74],['NRF2']
32498260,Thus NRF2 is a positive regulator of SAG-induced Hh signalingin MEFs,['NRF2']
32498260,Furthermore we also found ciliogenesis defectsin vivo in astrocytes of the mouse hippocampus a brain region whose function strongly relies onboth NRF2 and primary cilia [58 87–98],['NRF2']
32498260,Hence NRF2 is a positive regulatorof ciliogenesis explaining at least partly why it also promotes Hh signaling [58],['NRF2']
32498260,We then examined the mechanisms whereby NRF2 promotes ciliogenesis and Hh signaling,['NRF2']
32498260,Alternatively NRF2 mutant cells could have abnormally high levels of ciliophagy or ciliary autophagy a histone deacetylase 6 HDAC6 -dependent process [77 99],['NRF2']
32498260,As a next step we examined whether NRF2 promotes ciliogenic gene expression,['NRF2']
32498260,A parsimonious explanation of these data would be that NRF2 promotes expression of one or moreciliogenic transcription factors which would then upregulate IFT and other ciliogenic genes,['NRF2']
32498260,Alternatively NRF2 may act on ciliogenic genes not through other transcriptionfactors but directly,['NRF2']
32498260,Interestingly IFT74 IFT88 IFT172 andIFT140 all have high-scoring putative ARE sequences suggesting that NRF2 may directly upregulatethem [58],['NRF2']
32498260,Further evidence that Gpr161 and Ift27 and the ciliogenic Ift74 are NRF2 targets comesfrom their promoters being identiﬁed in a ChIP-seq experiment aiming to identify NRF2-bindingsites [104],['NRF2']
32498260,Thus NRF2 aﬀects Hh responsiveness both via ciliogenesis and via Hh pathway geneexpression which it controls directly at least in some cases,['NRF2']
32498260,For example one consideration is that Ptch1is not only a Hh GLI target gene but also as shown recently an NRF2 target gene; thus the reductionwe observed in SAG-treated NRF2-null cells may be explained at least partly by lack of direct NRF2activation [58 59],['NRF2']
32498260,A related question is whether the Hh target Gli1 is also a direct NRF2 target gene,['NRF2']
32498260,Thus it is possible that the reduced Hh responsiveness we observed in NRF2-null cells might be explained at least partly by direct NRF2 eﬀects on Hh target genes [58],['NRF2']
32498260,However there is so far no direct evidence indicating that Gli1 is an NRF2 target gene,['NRF2']
32498260,Moreover the observed NRF2-dependent changes in Ptch1 expression are weak compared to those in other NRF2target genes and therefore lack of direct NRF2 activation may explain only a small fraction of the strongreduction in SAG-induced Ptch1 levels observed in NRF2-null cells [58 59],['NRF2']
32498260,Consistently we detectedno increase in Gli1 or Ptch1 mRNAs in WT MEFs upon NRF2 stabilization with dimethyl fumarate anelectrophile activator of NRF2 [58 105–107],['NRF2']
32498260,This suggests that newly accumulated NRF2 molecules donot stimulate endogenous Gli1 or Ptch1 or do so only weakly,['NRF2']
32498260,Aside from any direct eﬀects of NRF2 on Gli1 and Ptch1 gene expression our data likely reﬂectreduced Hh signal transduction in NRF2-null cells as expected from their cilia defects and altered levelsof Hh pathway components,['NRF2']
32498260,Since IFT27-null cells display similar defects in GLI2 and GLI3 it is possible that NRF2 eﬀects onGLI2 and GLI3 are partly mediated by reduced IFT27 levels [108],['NRF2']
32498260,Taken together these data indicate that NRF2 promotes ciliogenesis and Hh signaling bystimulating in some cases directly the expression of genes associated with both these processes Figure 5 [58],['NRF2']
32498260,Since IFT27-null cells display similar defects in GLI2 and GLI3 it is possible that NRF2 effects on GLI2 and GLI3 are partly mediated by reduced IFT27 levels [108],['NRF2']
32498260,Taken together these data indicate that NRF2 promotes ciliogenesis and Hh signaling by stimulating in some cases directly the expression of genes associated with both these processes Figure 5 [58],['NRF2']
32498260,However recent work indicates that NRF2 can also function as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis and Hh pathway activity [59],['NRF2']
32498260,It is therefore of interest to review these data and discuss whether and how NRF2 may act both positively and negatively in these processes,['NRF2']
32498260,NRF2 Downregulation of Primary Cilia and Hh Signaling,['NRF2']
32498260,Although NRF2 is cytoprotective under normal conditions excessive NRF2 activity is oncogenic [110–120],['NRF2']
32498260,For instance NRF2 is frequently upregulated in non-small cell lung carcinoma NSCLC  where it stimulates tumorigenesis by activating key serine-glycine biosynthetic genes thereby providing precursors for glutathione and nucleotide production [111 120],['NRF2']

32498260,Moreover NRF2 is shown to repress the expression ofciliogenic genes and proteins KIF3A IFT88 and IFT20  and to reduce the levels of two ciliary proteins ARL13B and acetylated tubulin AcTub [59],['NRF2']
32498260,also ﬁnd that ciliobrevin HPI-4  a compound known to repress ciliogenesis is in fact an NRF2 inducer acting canonically via KEAP1Cys-151 as do electrophiles like dimethyl fumarate and the apocarotenoid bixin [59 106 107 121],['NRF2']
32498260,How can these data be reconciled with our ﬁndings that NRF2 promotes ciliogenesis and ciliogenicgene expression [58 59]? Our best guess is that the eﬀects of NRF2 are context-dependent,['NRF2']
32498260,Since westudied MEFs and mouse hippocampus the diﬀerent behavior of NRF2 in NSCLC cell lines may bedue to cell type-speciﬁc diﬀerences in NRF2 regulation or target gene accessibility,['NRF2']
32498260,Harder to explain iswhy NRF2 would promote ciliogenesis in one set of MEF experiments while inhibiting it in the other,['NRF2']
32498260,Furthermore since some ciliogenic transcription factors like RFX1-4 concomitantly regulatemultiple ciliogenic genes all it might take for NRF2 to switch from being a pro-ciliogenic factor to beingan anti-ciliogenic one could be to reverse the direction of how it regulates one of these pro-ciliogenicfactors [10],['NRF2']
32498260,Thus these data demonstrate that NRF2 regulates RFX4 in a context-dependent manner [58],['NRF2']
32498260,propose another mechanism for NRF2-dependentinhibition of ciliogenesis: upregulation by NRF2 of its known target the p62 SQSTM1 autophagyreceptor leads to increased formation of inclusion bodies ubiquitin-containing protein aggregateswhose assembly depends on p62 [75 76 123 124],['NRF2']
32498260,NRF2 stabilization increases protein levels andinclusion body targeting of OFD1 a ciliogenic repressor whose autophagic degradation enablesciliogenesis and ciliary entry of BBS4 a ciliopathy-associated protein [68],['NRF2']
32498260,In these cells genetic deletion of p62 completely abolishes ciliogenesis repression by the NRF2 inducer,['NRF2']
32498260,More studies are needed to elucidate how NRF2 represses ciliogenesis in these models,['NRF2']
32498260,NRF2 Downregulation of Hh Signaling,['NRF2']
32498260,clearly demonstrate that as we suggested might be the case PTCH1 is a bona ﬁde NRF2 target gene and that PTCH1 protein levels are reduced in NRF2-null cells [58 59],['NRF2']
32498260,did not provide further evidence that ligand-induced Hh signaling isaﬀected by NRF2 [59],['NRF2']
32498260,provide good evidence that NRF2 negatively regulates basal GLIreporter activity especially in the H1299 NSCLC line Figure 6,['NRF2']
32498260,In these cells NRF2 overexpression orbixin-induced stabilization reduces GLI-luciferase reporter activity by 30%–40%,['NRF2']
32498260,Likewise the ciliarylocalization of SMO is reduced 2-fold by these manipulations or by KEAP1 genetic deletion,['KEAP1']
32498260,Since Hh signaling is well-known to play a major role in NSCLC progression this suggests that the negative eﬀects of NRF2 on this pathway may antagonize tumorigenicity ratherthan promote it as suggested by Liu et al,['NRF2']
32498260,In other words while Hhligands are known to increase the GLI3FL GLI3R ratio by blocking GLI3FL-to-GLI3R processing the mechanism whereby NRF2 alters this ratio is still unknown,['NRF2']
32498260,NRF2 downregulates basal Hh pathway activity in NSCLC cells,['NRF2']
32498260,a In NRF2 WT NSCLC cell lines like H1299 SMO localizes constitutively at cilia indicative of active Hh signaling,['NRF2']
32498260,In these cells NRF2 levels are low as are its effects on both PTCH1 gene expression which it activates via an ARE in its promoter and GLI factors whose full length-to-repressor ratios FL R and transcriptional activity it downregulates via p62 SQSTM1,['NRF2']
32498260,b In NRF2-null KO H1299 cells lack of NRF2 leads to increased ciliogenic gene expression and increased ciliogenesis lower PTCH1 levels higher GLI FL R ratios and higher GLI-luciferase reporter Gli-Luc activity,['NRF2']

33114576,Despite the association with a high PD-L1 expression in a small cohortof resected NSCLC specimens [31] the presence of activating EGFR mutations is associated with lowexpression of PD-L1 on tumor cells as well as a poor outcome to ICIs [16 32–34],['EGFR']
33114576,Nonetheless thiseﬀect might be depending on the type of EGFR activating mutation [35 36],['EGFR']

33114576,Activated mTOR acts at thepost-transcriptional level by recruiting PD-L1 transcripts to active polysomes so that the PD-L1 proteinlevel is increased without a corresponding signiﬁcant elevation in mRNA levels [20],['MTOR']

33114576,For example as already mentioned EGFR activation by EGF binding caninduce PD-L1 expression on tumor cells; however EGFR-mutant NSCLCs tend to have lower PD-L1expression levels compared to EGFR-wild type tumors as a result of the interaction between tumorcells and the immune TME [38–40],"['EGFR', 'EGF']"

33114576,This can potentially lead to enhanced antitumor immunity although not allstudies were concordant since treatment with TKIs led to PD-L1 upregulation resulting in immunesuppression according to some reports [114],['TKIS']
33114576,It was so hypothesized that TKIs could have a dual-phaseregulation with PD-L1 downregulation in an early phase corresponding to the initial potent antitumoractivity of these drugs followed by a later phase corresponding to the onset of TKI resistance inwhich PD-L1 expression is increased [114 115],['TKIS']

33451052,The presence of a hypoxic environment in the TME andmetabolic differences of the M1 M2 macrophage phenotypes represent a complex tightlyregulated phenomenon inﬂuenced by various features of tumor and TME cells involved inregulating polarization [74 76],['M1']
33451052,M1 macrophages have an oxygen-dependent metabolismbased on glycolysis while M2 macrophages are present in hypoxic areas of the tumor beinginvolved in angiogenesis [77],['M1']
33451052,An emerging class of molecules involved in regulating the M1 M2 balance is repre-sented by miRNAs [78–80],['M1']
33451052,In NSCLC the M1 M2 balance is modu-lated by differently expressed miRNAs secreted by TME and tumor cells Figure 2 [84 85],['M1']
33451052,The current view on the M1 M2 balance suggests that the present macrophages are ina continuum phenotypic dynamic making it difﬁcult to appreciate their prognostic rolein NSCLC [86 87],['M1']
33451052,A better understanding of how different miRNAs could inﬂuence theM1 M2 balance could inﬂuence the development of novel targeted therapy approachesthat aim to re-educate the macrophages towards the M1 phenotype [74],['M1']
33451052,Furthermore a hypoxicenvironment was shown to stimulate miR-21 secretion by human bone marrow-derivedmesenchymal stem cells towards macrophages increasing the M1 M2 balance towards anM2 phenotype,['M1']
33451052,These genetic alterations result in an inhibition of M1 polarization activationof metastasis-related genes and promotion of the alternative M2 activation and tumormetastasis [116],['M1']
33451052,The upregulation of miR-1207-5p in macrophaged-THP1 cells switched the phenotype balance towards M1 by increasing IL-12 and IL-23and signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of the M2 features IL10 and VEGF,['M1']

33466360,KRAS is overwhelmingly the most commonly mutated RAS isoform in cancer com-prising 85% of oncogenic RAS mutations [1],['KRAS']
33466360,KRAS mutations are most frequently found inepithelial cancers such as pancreatic colorectal and lung adenocarcinomas [5 6],['KRAS']
33466360,Accordingto data from TCGA PanCancer Atlas Studies alterations in KRAS are found in around 64%of pancreatic tumours and 37% of colorectal tumours [5 6],['KRAS']

33466360,For KRAS the vast majority 83% of cancer-associatedmutations occur at codon 12 [1],['KRAS']
33466360,Despite its appeal KRAS has proven to be an elusive target,['KRAS']
33466360,Furthermore attempts to directly target KRAS have been hinderedby its structure: KRAS presents a smooth surface with no deep hydrophobic pockets thatwould allow tight binding [11],['KRAS']
33466360,Recent efforts to produce mutant subtype speciﬁc KRAS inhibitors have been morefruitful with the development of several small molecule inhibitors of KRASG12C,['KRAS']
33466360,Despite the high prevalence of KRAS mutations in pancreatic adenocarci-noma G12C is a minor subtype in this cohort ~1% [22 24 25],['KRAS']

33466360,Clearly these studies show great promise of efﬁcacy even in subgroups that havegenerally poor response to therapy such as patients with KRAS STK11 co-mutation,['KRAS']
33466360,A lack of dependency on KRAS signalling could account for some of the intrinsicresistance noted in pre-clinical models which may underlie the variable response seen inpatients [27 39 40],['KRAS']
33466360,RAS proteins exert their effects through multiple pathways includingthe MAPK ERK and PI3K AKT mTORC1 pathways although the PI3K pathway is notdependent on RAS alone for activation [41],['ERK']
33466360,Even with complete KRAS inhibition a subset of KRAS-mutantPDAC cells remain viable and a signiﬁcant majority of these demonstrate PI3K-dependentMAPK signalling and sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors [43],['KRAS']
33466360,Clinical at-tempts to target the MAPK pathway have previously focused on MEK but disappointinglythese inhibitors have proven to have limited therapeutic activity in KRAS-mutant lungcancer patients [47],['MEK']
33466360,The large multinational randomised control trial SELECT-1 compareddocetaxel alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in 510 patientswith KRAS-mutant NSCLC ﬁnding no signiﬁcant difference in progression-free or overallsurvival [48],['MEK']
33466360,Similarly a phase 2 study of the MEK inhibitor trametinib found no survivalbeneﬁt over docetaxel in pre-treated KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients [49],['MEK']
33466360,This is likely explained in part by the activation of alternative RAS dependent path-ways but it was also noted that MEK inhibition leads to relief of negative feedback mecha-nisms and subsequent upregulation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs [50 51],['MEK']
33466360,Interestingly loss of wild-type KRAShas been shown to increase sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant cell lines [54],['MEK']
33466360,The mechanism by which wild-type KRAS promotes resistance to MEK inhibition has notbeen fully elucidated but appears to rely on its ability to dimerise with mutant KRAS [55],"['KRAS', 'MEK']"
33466360,Dimerisation is also required for the function of oncogenic mutant KRAS,['KRAS']
33466360,Disruption ofdimerisation between wild-type and mutant KRAS may not only increase the sensitivity toMEK inhibitors but may also inhibit the biological function of mutant KRAS [55],['KRAS']
33466360,Furthermore this study identiﬁed no single RTK that was criticalfor all KRASG12C models but found that co-inhibition of SHP2 resulted in universal andsustained inhibition of feedback reactivation [58],['SHP2']
33466360,Despite similar study designs the differing conclusions of the two aforementionedstudies raises the question of whether resistance is mediated through wild-type RAS newly produced mutant KRAS or both [39 57 58],['KRAS']
33466360,Regardless both studies identiﬁed theimportance of RTK and SHP2 activation in acquired resistance,['SHP2']
33466360,SHP2 is a phosphatase thatmediates signaling from multiple RTKs to the RAS pathway and as such offers an attractivetarget for KRASG12C combination therapy [59],['SHP2']
33466360,Mirati are testing this combination in aphase 1 2 clinical trial NCT04330664 and several other trials of SHP2 inhibitors alone orin combination with other agents are currently underway Table 1,['SHP2']

33466360,SHP2 co-inhibition also appears to lead to a more favourable immune microenvironment and sensitised tumours to PD-1 inhibition [65],['SHP2']
33466360,In agreement with these findings the SHP2 inhibitor TNO155 has been shown to overcome feedback reactivation of RTK signalling induced by G12C inhibition and was found to act synergistically with the G12C inhibitor Cpd 12a to inhibit proliferation in KRASG12C cell lines,['SHP2']
33466360,This synergistic effect was the most significant of all TNO155 combinations tested in the study and was also postulated to be secondary to increased GDP occupancy of KRAS [66],['KRAS']

33466360,KRAS activates multiple downstream pathways and consequently inhibition of down-stream targets would be expected to offer less efﬁcacy than direct or upstream targeting [39],['KRAS']
33466360,The importance of this relationship is supported by studies show-ing a synergistic effect between MEK inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors in lung and PDACmodels [69 70],['MEK']
